        "selftext": "In the 2022/2023 tax year, I sold my house and bought another in the 2023/2024. The funds were in the account long enough to accrue a fair bit of interest and I expected to pay and did pay the tax on the interest.\n\nI have a MyGov account, but as I'm not on any form of Centrelink etc, I don't check the inbox very often and it defaulted to not notifying me via email/text when new letters were in the MyGov inbox.\n\nI went in to check my HECS figures and found that I somehow owed $1,900 plus interest. A phone call to the ATO revealed that this owing amount was on advanced payments the ATO automatically signed me up for in the 2024/2025 tax year \"in case\" I had interest from bank accounts that attracts interest every quarter, apparently. \n\nAfter explaining the situation and that there are no funds there to accumulate interest, I was informed that it's just their process that automatically sign you up for it and to send an email to the MyGov inbox in case you wanted to \"opt out\" but because the terms and conditions of MyGov are that you have to check it regularly, they are unable to remove the debt.\n\nOne would think that once you filed the 2024/2025 taxes, it would nullify/cancel out, right?! Nope. You have to pay it out of your pocket, file the return and wait WEEKS for it to be offset against your taxes and/or refunded...\n\nI raised a dispute with the ATO and they upheld the decision. So now I have to come up with a fair chunk of cash that they can hold onto - plus interest - because they're advanced taxing me on interest on an account that has no money in it to accrue interest.
