        "title": "Which Australian bank has the least restrictive withdrawal limits?",
        "selftext": "Hello, maybe a super silly and mundane question, but which Australian bank with decent coverage across the country actually has decent in-person withdrawal limits for cash anymore?\n\nI was without my card and I needed cash to pay for something (which I routinely pay for using that amount of withdrawed cash, and it's not even remotely sus) and it became apparent at Commbank that I could only make a cardless cash withdrawal of up to 500 dollars a day. Furthermore, no human being could override this, and it was supposed to be 2000 dollars a day but had been arbitrarily reduced to 500 by \"the system\". This is strange because I have never been in any sort of big debt, financial distress, scams or any other reason I shouldn't be able to withdraw more money. Was I flagged for some weird reason they can't tell me or is a computer with no human supervision really all you can grapple with unless your local branch is open?\n\nShould I go to another bank that doesn't handhold me and withhold my money from me when I'm actually in a bit of a pickle? Yes, admittedly everyone should have some cash on hand for power outages/situations like this, but your bank should not make your life harder for no reason. ",

Unfortunately at this stage I\u2019m in no position to be buying the cars I\u2019m after outright, as I\u2019ve done so in the past for years. \n\nI am a beneficiary of a family trust, and recieve tax free money every month, around the 10k margin. I also have another vehicle, both vehicles are in my name and fully owned outright, that I have mentioned I\u2019m wanting to sell privately as the dealer prices on trade-ins are pitiful.

I\u2019ve been able to prove I\u2019ve been receiving payments for going on 6 years now, and it\u2019s been impossible! Especially with commonwealth bank.
