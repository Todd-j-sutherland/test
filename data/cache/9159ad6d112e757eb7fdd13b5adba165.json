        "selftext": "Hello, maybe a super silly and mundane question, but which Australian bank with decent coverage across the country actually has decent in-person withdrawal limits for cash anymore?\n\nI was without my card and I needed cash to pay for something (which I routinely pay for using that amount of withdrawed cash, and it's not even remotely sus) and it became apparent at Commbank that I could only make a cardless cash withdrawal of up to 500 dollars a day. Furthermore, no human being could override this, and it was supposed to be 2000 dollars a day but had been arbitrarily reduced to 500 by \"the system\". This is strange because I have never been in any sort of big debt, financial distress, scams or any other reason I shouldn't be able to withdraw more money. Was I flagged for some weird reason they can't tell me or is a computer with no human supervision really all you can grapple with unless your local branch is open?\n\nShould I go to another bank that doesn't handhold me and withhold my money from me when I'm actually in a bit of a pickle? Yes, admittedly everyone should have some cash on hand for power outages/situations like this, but your bank should not make your life harder for no reason. ",

Playing around with some new tooling. \n\nNow it\u2019s a live app where you can:\n\n* Explore short interest by company (e.g. CBA) or sector (e.g. Basic Materials)\n* Skim daily summaries of the biggest moves\n* Spot sentiment shifts or pressure on individual stocks\n\nWould love feedback, especially from traders or anyone keeping a close eye on the ASX.\n\n[https://aussieshorts.report/](https://aussieshorts.report/)",
