I graduated a 4 year pharmacy degree in 2013 and interned for a year in 2014 at 22 years old. In 2017 I completed my MBA and also got a cash gift of $20k from my parents. Accrued $58k of HECS debt including $7,300 of indexation that took 10 years to pay off by 2024.\n\n# 1.1 Career Progression\n\nI worked in my home town for 3 years after graduation in a 9-5 before starting locum work in 2017 when my income took off. I was chasing the highest paid contracts in new locations I hadn\u2019t traveled to before. I would cover maternity/paternity contracts, owner/staff annual leave, busy holiday periods etc. This work coupled my thrill of making money with my desire to travel and see new places. I have worked in over 30 towns/cities in Australia and visited/camped in scores more in between contracts. Contracts could range from 2 weeks to 3 months.\n\nI love my job! I\u2019m a huge people person so being able to help people with their minor or major health care needs really makes me fulfilled! I have been very lucky to happen into a profession that I enjoy and has had really good wage growth.\u00a0\n\nIt was tough and stressful working as a contractor for 8 years under an ABN without annual/sick leave: sourcing contracts, negotiating contracts, syncing work calendars with social and personal commitments, living out of a cars and suitcases, driving thousands of kilometres to new jobs, difficult lending landscape, lumpy income, being away from friends and family etc. But the money was far better compared to working a regular pharmacy job. Being hourly I also maxed my workload while on contract so would routinely average 55 to 60 hours per week depending on the contract.\n\n# 1.2 Current Role\n\nIn 2025 my position is with a state government: $155k including 12.75% super. I received a $30k sign on bonus and will get a $20k retention bonus at 12 & 24 months. Accommodation is included as the location is a rural site. I work 38h Monday - Friday with an unpaid hour for lunch! The new work/life balance was great for 2 months. Then I started locuming on weekends because I\u2019m addicted to the hourly rate! Currently working 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on a Sunday for $110/h gross. So I\u2019m 52h/week across 7 days which is manageable but I (mostly my gf) would really like a day off. I\u2019m currently looking at dropping my two weekend shifts and negotiating a 14 hour shift on a Saturday at a new pharmacy for the $110/h rate! Same 52h but across 6 days. Perfect.\n\n# 2.0 Expenses and Savings Rate\n\n|Item|FY '22|FY '23|FY '24|FY '25|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Expenses**|**$38,906**|**$28,097**|**$35,143**|**$36,944**|\n|Debits|$7,391|$9,140|$3,556|$76|\n|Credit Card|$5,184|$9,207|$9,561|$19,631|\n|Joint A/c|$6,704|$9,750|$8,809|$6,481|\n|Int\u2019 Travel|$19,627|$0|$13,217|$10,756|\n||||||\n|**Post-tax SR**|**23.3%**|**77.8%**|**75.7%**|**76.3%**|\n\n# 2.1 Expenses in my 20s\n\nThrough uni (2010-2013) I worked casually at a pharmacy. Was paid quite a bit for an 18-21 year old pharmacy student so was pretty happy! Never really saved anything or invested at this stage. Lucky to live at home through my uni degree rent free. Spent all my cash buying 3 progressively more expensive second hand cars over 5 years which all needed hella repairs. Spent the rest of my money on house hold goods, food, booze, partying, drugs, domestic travel, dating, fashion, whatever. When I started working my pharmacy internship in 2014 I was paying $150/w in rent to my parents. This continued until I moved out in 2016 and had a mortgage with adult bills. Wasn\u2019t much left over after budgeting for bills and mortgage. You can see my income that year took a big dip! Was paid far more as a student than an intern!\n\n# 2.2 Adult Expenses\n\n2017 you can see my income increased a lot when I started locum work. So of course I dialled up the spend! I\u2019d converted my PPOR to an IP as I left my home town to start work on the road. So from 2017 until January 2025 I have never paid rent or a PPOR mortgage repayment. I negotiated contracts with employers to cover accommodation and usually travel costs. Sometimes it was caravan parks or motels, sometimes AirBnBs, the owner\u2019s homes or hotels. In between contracts we camp, stay with friends/family, overseas travel or book domestic accommodation. Currently I split $250/w with my gf for a room in a city I travel to for work on weekends. Having very little housing costs obviously has kept my living expenses extremely low. Not feasible forever but great to help me increase my savings rate and get a head start on investing.\n\nFortunate to have met my partner traveling in 2019 who was also on board with FI! This year she is now CoastFI on her overseas assets. We share all our living and travel expenses through a joint bank account we contribute to equally. I apportion the property portfolio equity, debt and cashflow 50/50 with her in our individual NW numbers. We have and will continue to use a mix of our cash for deposits and expenses. In the event of a breakup we will split the property assets 50/50 after paying out our individual contributions and cash in the offsets. All our other assets are separate.\n\n# 2.3 Savings Rate\n\nI keep spending pretty tight these days but I LOVE paying for convenience. I love not having to be stressed about the price of catching an Uber/Taxi, price of groceries, or buying/replacing something that I want when I need it. I don\u2019t bother tracking my spending too closely. I do have a budget that I update every year with my big known expenses and guestimates for fuel, food and discretionary spending etc but I don\u2019t reconcile it. The budgeted expenses come out pretty close to my top line spend in my Expenses/SR table so I don\u2019t feel the need to get more granular. The only thing I itemise further is international travel because that\u2019s a big part of my FI life! Savings rate has been >70% since I\u2019ve been living life thru the FI lens so I CBFd scrutinising my expenses any further.\n\n# 2.4 Lifestyle Creep\n\nI do love dropping a bomb on holidays though! 2018/19 spent $20.2k in SE Asia for 9 months meeting my gf at the end of it. 2022 I spent $19.6k on 4 months across 8 US states and Brazil. 2024 I spent $13.2k on 10 weeks in South America. 2025 I spent $10.7k on 4 weeks in the US.\u00a0\n\nAlready we've inflated our travel lifestyle by booking Airbnbs/hotels in our desired areas instead of hostels in a cheaper location. We book flights with convenient departure/arrival times even if they're more expensive. We have a spend-like-we\u2019re-rich rule on holiday to help us really enjoy ourselves. I'd love to be in a position to travel more often, upgrade to business class for flights >5 hours, dial up the luxury a lil in the accommodation we book, travel to more expensive locations, hire a private driver/tour guide, ball out on experiences in incredible locations etc. The lifestyle creep will come easy so I need to grow my NW to support the spend I want to have.\n\n# 3.0 Investing\n\n# Net Worth Summary\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Net Worth**|**$251,919**|**$390,401**|**$473,245**|**$708,486**|\n|$ increase||$138,482|$82,845|$229,240|\n|% increase||54.97%|21.22%|48.44%|\n\n# Assets\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Super|$58,227|$97,909|$134,719|$213,047|\n|Equities|$65,517|$59,176|$78,007|$146,269|\n|Property|$217,000|$206,000|$470,000|$762,500|\n|Crypto|$31,754|$56,260|$79,649|$104,036|\n|Cash|$29,607|$122,965|$88,600|$47,722|\n|Car|$9,125|$9,125|$8,000|$6,000|\n|**Total**|**$411,229**|**$551,435**|**$858,976**|**$1,273,574**|\n\n# Debt\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mortgage|$158,500|$154,995|$382,766|$567,200|\n|Credit Card|$810|$6,039|$2,964|$3,888|\n|**Total**|**$159,310**|**$161,034**|**$385,730**|**$571,088**|\n\nn.b.

From 2017 I had been \u2018investing\u2019 in assets with no real plan: penny stocks, single stocks, oil futures, crypto and some thematic ETFs. Clearly had employed zero education and strategy on how to invest in any asset class.\u00a0Had some winners and losers but ended up with a modest CGT bill. The gain pales in comparison to the returns I would have received by buying another IP or investing in my Super and ETFs since 2017 instead.\n\n# 3.2 Getting Educated\n\nIn 2022 I came back from another big, expensive, overseas holiday. I had spent all my cash and a my mix of random assets were in decline. I was again canvasing for some lucrative contracts to fill up the bank account. I knew I had to be more intentional with my money if I wanted to continue this lifestyle of travel and part-time work. I was getting into podcasts at this time and had been writing down a few book titles about investing, personal finance and self-help. So I dove into that!\n\nAfter my learning and finding r/FIAustralia and some other Subreddits I had discovered the 4% guideline and NW calculations. I was surprised to find that my NW was a touch over $250k, albeit spread across a bunch of random asset classes. Seeing that number at 29 years old was really motivating. I knew I could accelerate this journey by earning more. You can see from earnings FY23-FY25 my income increased a lot. I took less holidays but my hourly rate as a locum had also kept increasing. During downtime at work and after hours I spent an obscene amount of time devouring podcasts, books, articles, paid courses, webinars, websites, YT videos, Instagram reels, TikToks and Reddit learning as much as I could about investing, personal finance and property. I sold almost all my random mix of assets back to cash then I came up with my plan:\u00a0Super, property, ETFs, crypto. In that order.\n\n# 3.3 Super Philosophy\n\nI love Super. There is no better tax advantaged way to invest your money for building wealth. Yes Super is locked away until retirement age but that\u2019s the whole point of investing: allowing time to compound your capital by reinvesting the dividends while you add to the pile. By contributing to Super early you are allowing those extra tax dollars saved and contributed capital the longest time possible to compound, tax free!! If something catastrophic happens where I can no longer work and all my money is \u201clocked up\u201d in Super there are early access schemes, income protection, TPD insurance, government welfare programs, other assets, family and friends etc. There are myriad options to support you in the worst-case scenario instead of ignoring Super.\n\nYou really need to take care of yourself for when you\u2019re elderly and too broken to keep working. You do this by jacking your Super to the tits ASAP and then you can start bringing your retirement age back by investing outside of Super.\u00a0If you can\u2019t afford to top your Super up to the current $30k limit after your employer Super Guarantee (SG) you\u2019re probably not earning enough to retire that early anyway. Which means you should definitely prioritise Super. I love [this article](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/how-much-to-save-inside-vs-outside-super/#stages) from\u00a0[PassiveInvestingAustralia.com](http://PassiveInvestingAustralia.com)\u00a0showing how prioritising your Super as an investment will actually help you retire sooner as a low income earner. If you are a high earner you can afford to top up to $30k. You should definitely prioritise Super for the 15% (and 30% DIV293) tax rate which will be miles better than your marginal tax rates. \u00a0\n\n# 3.4 My Super Investment\n\n**$213,046.51** | **31.15% of NW**\n\nHaving the SG since I started working as a casual pharmacy student in 2011 meant I had a good head start on my balance. In 2020 I took out the COVID relief $20k. In hindsight I should have left it in there of course. Especially considering I left it in cash for over 6 months, missing the big V shaped recovery and new all time highs! Oops. In FY23 my income had increased a lot and I was looking for tax deductions. Checking MyGov, I had $90k of unused concessional contributions! I am spreading those tax deductions over 3-4 years to use them up consecutively before they expire after 5 years. I use concessional contributions and salary sacrificing to max my yearly cap and fill up previous unused caps.\n\nThrough my income and investment income in the future I always see myself maxing my contribution limit to Super. I may over invest in Super but I\u2019m not looking to retire ASAP and I plan to give a lot of my wealth away before I die. Investing in Super will give me a huge pot that could help a lot of people! I also plan on maintaining my pharmacy registration over the coming decades. I am required to work an annual 150 hours minimum. Perpetually CoastFI!\n\nI hate that DIV296 tax applies to unrealised gains. I don\u2019t mind taxing Super more above $3m on realised gains though. No one needs that much in Super. Based on my projections I will be close to that balance in 27 years at a traditional retirement age.\n\n# 3.5 Property Philosophy\n\nTalk about a tax deduction: if I love Super, then I\u2019m HORNY FOR PROPERTY! I actually don\u2019t love negative gearing though. Losing money to save your marginal tax rate is an absurd strategy but that's what we're stuck with in Australia. Can\u2019t wait to get my portfolio to neutral territory. I do love to claim the non-cash expenses like depreciation though! Leveraging to buy property is the best way to compound your capital IMO. You have way more control over your assets, can manufacture equity and directly increase the yields. You don\u2019t have that level of finesse over companies in the share market (unless you\u2019re getting a board seat lol). The massive low-cost leverage you can apply to your capital by investing in property makes it a superior investment option to build wealth compared to the light leverage you can get with equities. I think debt recycling is a really sexy strategy too and I can\u2019t wait to utilise that when we buy a home!\n\nThe reason property was second on my list of priorities over ETFs is two-fold, though related. Firstly, with leverage you can control a large dollar value of assets in the market. You want to benefit from the maximum amount of assets growing in the market for the most time possible. Secondly: government mandated inflation at 2-3% erodes the value of the debt. So you need to take on the debt and buy the assets ASAP to allow positive compounding on the largest amount of assets and negative compounding on your debt through inflation! This move was all about time. Maximising the time you control these huge assets with maximum leverage will compound better returns.\n\n# 3.6 My Property Investment\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|IPs|2.5|\n|Total Value|$1,525,000|\n|Total Debt|$1,134,400|\n|Net Value|$390,600|\n|Leverage Ratio|74%|\n|Offset Account|$47,722|\n|**Net Value**|**$438,322**|\n\n# Profit / Loss Statement\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Income|$74,620|\n|Total Expenses|$104,781|\n|Offset Gain Back|$2,983|\n|**Estimated Cashflow before tax**|**\u2013$27,178**|\n|Depreciation|$17,128|\n|Accountant Expense|$2,500|\n|Land Tax|$0|\n|Tax Rate %|39%|\n|**Estimated Cashflow after tax**|**\u2013$11,424**|\n\n# Blended Interest Rate                                                       6.25%\n\n**Equity share of $195 300 is 27.65% of NW.**\n\nIn 2016 I grossly overpaid on a house and land package in a Townsville suburb with lots of developable land AND in a flood zone! I\u2019m very nervous every wet season in NQld. But it didn\u2019t flood in 2019 (just) or during this year\u2019s flood event in March.\u00a0I knew nothing about investing in property evidenced in the fact that I was negative equity until it finally grew enough 8 years later to negate the premium I paid the developer and builder. I built this house with my then gf and still own it 50/50 as tenants in common. I put in $23k cash, she $13k, and we were $405k all in. Current valuation 600k so a pretty poor effort over 8.5 years especially as the growth only came the last 18 months. It is a 7%+ gross yield on purchase now so it has been positively geared last two FYs at least. I plan to add a 4th bedroom by enclosing a 2nd living area to add an estimated 80-90k of equity based on comparables in the suburb and selling it in 2026. I will unlock the equity as cash, get the borrowing capacity back and dissolve the complex loan product I hold over the property with my ex. I need to check with my accountant but I think I can claim the 6 year rule on partial gains up to 2022 as I haven\u2019t claimed another PPOR. I didn\u2019t get it valued at the 6 year mark though so this might prove difficult if it\u2019s even possible!\n\nSecond property was also purchased in Townsville. May \u201824, 10% down at 450k with 5.4% gross yield, cash deposit. Bank valuation this June: 575k!! Third property in Mackay. Purchased September \u201824, 10% down at 570k with 5.02% gross yield cash and equity from property #1. Bank valuation this June: $650k!! So there\u2019s almost 400k of equity in the portfolio ATM. As a pharmacist I can get 90% LVR lend no LMI without being punished on the rates. It\u2019s a great lending product and very happy to be able to take advantage! I am pre-approved for 600k more in my personal name with this loan product. I plan to use this to buy in one of three locations: Lavington, Albury; South Grafton, NSW or Bendigo, VIC. Suburb medians are 500-570k and growing with demand and supply side data metrics looking promising while gross yields of 5%+ are achievable.\n\n# 3.7 Future Property Plans\n\nI\u2019m close to my Qld land tax threshold in my personal name and want to diversify states. WA and SA have had a lot of growth and Victoria has a few investors head winds: They have a low land tax threshold (50k!) and have hostile landlord policies. There\u2019s lots of developable land down that way so will have less of a supply constraint long term compared to other markets.\u00a0There\u2019s still potential for growth but I think there\u2019s better opportunities in NSW and Qld.\n\nGoing forward I will need to utilise trust structures to preserve my borrowing capacity. Broker says I\u2019ll be tapped out with the majors after #4 but I will still be able to lend with 2nd and 3rd tier lenders, especially if I let go of property #1. My 5th purchase is going to be a commercial property. I will then pigeon pair that inside the same trust with another growth property. This will help me pay off the debt of the commercial property in the future while keeping the trust positive through this holding period. The banks can disregard the debt inside that trust if it\u2019s positive cash flow and I can lend again based on my personal capacity. Strategy has been fleshed out with my broker and tax agent. It\u2019s risky obviously but damn I just love leverage.\n\nI don\u2019t have a goal for portfolio size, equity position or cashflow, but looking at growth on a $4.5m assets base in a [Future Value calculator](https://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html?cyearsv=30&cstartingprinciplev=4%2C500%2C000&cinterestratev=5&ccontributeamountv=0&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=Calculate#calresult) looks pretty good to me! Achievable too once I move into commercial property assets where I will be buying in higher price points.\n\n# 3.8 My ETF Investments\n\n**20.71% of NW**\n\n|Ticker|Allocation|Value|Contributions|%ROI|$ROI|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|VGS|61.24%|$89,570|$52,930|69.22%|$36,640|\n|VAS|21.96%|$32,121|$20,291|58.30%|$11,830|\n|GHFF|16.80%|$24,578|$21,879|12.34%|$2,699|\n|**Total**|**100.00%**|**$146,269**|**$95,100**|**53.81%**|**$51,170**|\n\nI\u2019m actually most obsessed with equities. Little bits of money that grow and pay you dividends. The worst thing that happens is they go down in price! Then you can buy more or use the income from the investments to buy more! So accessible, liquid, powerful. It has been third on my list of priorities as I gathered deposits and cashed in on Super deductions. Cashflow can get tight with my Super/Property strategy and I\u2019m not very liquid. So storing cash and extra savings in ETFs is my new drug! It really adds a lot of liquidity and accessible reserves to my portfolio. I burnt myself on some fun thematics like YOLO, ARKK and HCLN over the years. When I sold most of my assets to restructure my finances in 2022 I was down 24k on those. Sold out of my oil futures, single stocks as well (wish I\u2019d kept Palantir!). Went all in on an 80/20 VGS/VAS portfolio. Recently though I have been really excited about GHHF. It has a higher Oz content than I\u2019d like at 37% so I\u2019m continuing to buy VGS as well to keep me within my desired allocation. I haven\u2019t decided yet what ratio I want of leveraged ETFs but if I know myself, it will be as close to 100% as that mathematical asymptote will let me get lol. Leverage is just so sexy the way it juices returns! \u00a0\n\n# 3.9 My Crypto Investments\n\n**$104,036.11** | **14.73% of NW** | **BCH(69%)/BTC(18%)/ETH(13%)**\n\nI am a huge fan of transparent and immutable blockchain technology. It has a lot of applications. I\u2019m still waiting for the killer app, but it isn\u2019t BTC. I bought BTC in 2017 and also sold it in 2017 because it had gone up a lot and\u00a0transactions were congested and fees were so high it was unusable as peer to peer cash. I thought it would crash because it was useless; and still is with high fees and handicapped transaction volume. Big regrets tho lol.\n\nIf you know anything about crypto I didn\u2019t sell before the BCH hard fork at least. So I got all those coins for free! Which forked twice more for BSV and XEC. In 2022 during the great restructuring I sold the latter two hard forks for free money and also 12 shitcoins I had accumulated. I kept all my BCH and add to it regularly. For me it\u2019s the most useful crypto. You can send any amount instantly, peer to peer for less than a cent to anyone, anywhere in the world! The transaction is always confirmed in the next block for immutability. I love it. Couldn\u2019t resist DCAing back into BTC because damn that thing just keeps going up! I also invest in ETH. Crystallised $34k in gains from crypto over the years so Ive only got $24k of capital in my crypto portfolio.\n\nI think there\u2019s a place for crypto in anyone\u2019s portfolio but it has to be about a project you know and think has utility. My allocation is a little high at 14.73% relative to NW. Adding to my other assets will make my crypto allocation a smaller part of my NW over time. I don\u2019t expect the growth to be as explosive going forward so it should balance out soon. Aiming for 10% allocation of my NW.\n\n# 4.0\u00a0Future Plans and Goals\n\nHaving average expenses of <40kpa means I\u2019m not far from my FIRE number! However I expect my spend to increase significantly over the next decade. We will eventually start renting a \u201cdream home\u201d or purchase a PPOR, dial up the spend on travel/hobbies and charitable giving, and setup an awesome camping rig which will have significant ownership costs. I also love a bit of luxury so my FI number is likely much higher. I guess my minimum goal is around $1.5-1.9m which is 60-76kp on a 4% SWR. I still have another 2-3 years of building my property portfolio so will need to continue working full-time for servicing. Then I\u2019m feeling a CoastFI vibe while my assets compound for me. I will work a mandated 150 hours per year minimum to maintain my pharmacy registration and fluctuate my workload as I need. The question I\u2019m mulling over is what does that CoastFI job look like over the coming years?\n\nI could easily stay with this government job as it\u2019s been very relaxing and well paid with free accommodation. The rural site is not my gf\u2019s favourite place though so I probably can\u2019t stay for more than 18 months. Have been keeping an eye on other state health jobs for internal transfer. I could go back to locuming. I have a great network and there\u2019s still plenty of work on but my gf is definitely over it having traveled with me for 4 years! It\u2019s also a more difficult lending landscape for servicing. The other option is getting into a business partnership. Having met dozens of pharmacy owners over the years I have been offered 4 partnerships. Pharmacies usually return 10-15% on owners equity! You need to be a pharmacist to own a pharmacy so there\u2019s less competition to get in. It\u2019s also a protected industry from competitors and both sides of government are pro locally-owned community pharmacies compared to the corporate pharmacy business model you see in the US, for example. It\u2019s an enticing prospect. It would be a challenge and the pay off on the back end will be great into the future. I don\u2019t know if I have it in me though when I can get to where I\u2019m going on my current \u201ceasy\u201d path. Something to contemplate as I learn and grow as a person and an investor!\u00a0\n\n# 5.0 Resources\n\nIf you want a list of resources that I liked the most from my learning I share it regularly in subs.

          "selftext": "I once worked in a call centre position for a \"middle-man\" company that assisted in retaining monthly donors to some major charities (National Breast Cancer Foundation, McGrath Foundation, Seeing Eye Dogs, I forgot the rest but others were also major ones).\n\nAll we would do are 3 minute calls, after you signed up to support a foundation in a shopping centre, verifying your details and clarifying your commitment. At this point, we would be the \"empathetic salesman\" and adjust your donation amount incase you feel you over committed. But again, the goal is retainment.\n\nIn the fine print, that no one ever reads, it says that 97% of your donation for the first 2 years goes to our company and after those 2 years your money goes to the charity itself (I dont recall if that was 100% to the charity or not). Our company operated all across Australia and even started operating the front lines trying to get people signed up. The line they would have to say is, \"The X foundation really does benefit the most from donations of 2 years or more\" and then slap on a slogan at the end which is given to us by the foundation themself. We go by scripts for just about every question you have and the answers are all to entice you to stay donating your money.\n\nFinance wise, even the people who stand in a shopping mall asking you to do monthly donations may not even work directly for that foundation. You are allowed to ask if they get commission (they do), and how much of the money goes to the charity, but that doesn't mean people won't lie.\n\nMore of a moral finance thing than a tax purposes one here. I quite after a month. If you donate directly through their website, you skip all the outside dodgy-ness.",

I graduated a 4 year pharmacy degree in 2013 and interned for a year in 2014 at 22 years old. In 2017 I completed my MBA and also got a cash gift of $20k from my parents. Accrued $58k of HECS debt including $7,300 of indexation that took 10 years to pay off by 2024.\n\n# 1.1 Career Progression\n\nI worked in my home town for 3 years after graduation in a 9-5 before starting locum work in 2017 when my income took off. I was chasing the highest paid contracts in new locations I hadn\u2019t traveled to before. I would cover maternity/paternity contracts, owner/staff annual leave, busy holiday periods etc. This work coupled my thrill of making money with my desire to travel and see new places. I have worked in over 30 towns/cities in Australia and visited/camped in scores more in between contracts. Contracts could range from 2 weeks to 3 months.\n\nI love my job! I\u2019m a huge people person so being able to help people with their minor or major health care needs really makes me fulfilled! I have been very lucky to happen into a profession that I enjoy and has had really good wage growth.\u00a0\n\nIt was tough and stressful working as a contractor for 8 years under an ABN without annual/sick leave: sourcing contracts, negotiating contracts, syncing work calendars with social and personal commitments, living out of a cars and suitcases, driving thousands of kilometres to new jobs, difficult lending landscape, lumpy income, being away from friends and family etc. But the money was far better compared to working a regular pharmacy job. Being hourly I also maxed my workload while on contract so would routinely average 55 to 60 hours per week depending on the contract.\n\n# 1.2 Current Role\n\nIn 2025 my position is with a state government: $155k including 12.75% super. I received a $30k sign on bonus and will get a $20k retention bonus at 12 & 24 months. Accommodation is included as the location is a rural site. I work 38h Monday - Friday with an unpaid hour for lunch! The new work/life balance was great for 2 months. Then I started locuming on weekends because I\u2019m addicted to the hourly rate! Currently working 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on a Sunday for $110/h gross. So I\u2019m 52h/week across 7 days which is manageable but I (mostly my gf) would really like a day off. I\u2019m currently looking at dropping my two weekend shifts and negotiating a 14 hour shift on a Saturday at a new pharmacy for the $110/h rate! Same 52h but across 6 days. Perfect.\n\n# 2.0 Expenses and Savings Rate\n\n|Item|FY '22|FY '23|FY '24|FY '25|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Expenses**|**$38,906**|**$28,097**|**$35,143**|**$36,944**|\n|Debits|$7,391|$9,140|$3,556|$76|\n|Credit Card|$5,184|$9,207|$9,561|$19,631|\n|Joint A/c|$6,704|$9,750|$8,809|$6,481|\n|Int\u2019 Travel|$19,627|$0|$13,217|$10,756|\n||||||\n|**Post-tax SR**|**23.3%**|**77.8%**|**75.7%**|**76.3%**|\n\n# 2.1 Expenses in my 20s\n\nThrough uni (2010-2013) I worked casually at a pharmacy. Was paid quite a bit for an 18-21 year old pharmacy student so was pretty happy! Never really saved anything or invested at this stage. Lucky to live at home through my uni degree rent free. Spent all my cash buying 3 progressively more expensive second hand cars over 5 years which all needed hella repairs. Spent the rest of my money on house hold goods, food, booze, partying, drugs, domestic travel, dating, fashion, whatever. When I started working my pharmacy internship in 2014 I was paying $150/w in rent to my parents. This continued until I moved out in 2016 and had a mortgage with adult bills. Wasn\u2019t much left over after budgeting for bills and mortgage. You can see my income that year took a big dip! Was paid far more as a student than an intern!\n\n# 2.2 Adult Expenses\n\n2017 you can see my income increased a lot when I started locum work. So of course I dialled up the spend! I\u2019d converted my PPOR to an IP as I left my home town to start work on the road. So from 2017 until January 2025 I have never paid rent or a PPOR mortgage repayment. I negotiated contracts with employers to cover accommodation and usually travel costs. Sometimes it was caravan parks or motels, sometimes AirBnBs, the owner\u2019s homes or hotels. In between contracts we camp, stay with friends/family, overseas travel or book domestic accommodation. Currently I split $250/w with my gf for a room in a city I travel to for work on weekends. Having very little housing costs obviously has kept my living expenses extremely low. Not feasible forever but great to help me increase my savings rate and get a head start on investing.\n\nFortunate to have met my partner traveling in 2019 who was also on board with FI! This year she is now CoastFI on her overseas assets. We share all our living and travel expenses through a joint bank account we contribute to equally. I apportion the property portfolio equity, debt and cashflow 50/50 with her in our individual NW numbers. We have and will continue to use a mix of our cash for deposits and expenses. In the event of a breakup we will split the property assets 50/50 after paying out our individual contributions and cash in the offsets. All our other assets are separate.\n\n# 2.3 Savings Rate\n\nI keep spending pretty tight these days but I LOVE paying for convenience. I love not having to be stressed about the price of catching an Uber/Taxi, price of groceries, or buying/replacing something that I want when I need it. I don\u2019t bother tracking my spending too closely. I do have a budget that I update every year with my big known expenses and guestimates for fuel, food and discretionary spending etc but I don\u2019t reconcile it. The budgeted expenses come out pretty close to my top line spend in my Expenses/SR table so I don\u2019t feel the need to get more granular. The only thing I itemise further is international travel because that\u2019s a big part of my FI life! Savings rate has been >70% since I\u2019ve been living life thru the FI lens so I CBFd scrutinising my expenses any further.\n\n# 2.4 Lifestyle Creep\n\nI do love dropping a bomb on holidays though! 2018/19 spent $20.2k in SE Asia for 9 months meeting my gf at the end of it. 2022 I spent $19.6k on 4 months across 8 US states and Brazil. 2024 I spent $13.2k on 10 weeks in South America. 2025 I spent $10.7k on 4 weeks in the US.\u00a0\n\nAlready we've inflated our travel lifestyle by booking Airbnbs/hotels in our desired areas instead of hostels in a cheaper location. We book flights with convenient departure/arrival times even if they're more expensive. We have a spend-like-we\u2019re-rich rule on holiday to help us really enjoy ourselves. I'd love to be in a position to travel more often, upgrade to business class for flights >5 hours, dial up the luxury a lil in the accommodation we book, travel to more expensive locations, hire a private driver/tour guide, ball out on experiences in incredible locations etc. The lifestyle creep will come easy so I need to grow my NW to support the spend I want to have.\n\n# 3.0 Investing\n\n# Net Worth Summary\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Net Worth**|**$251,919**|**$390,401**|**$473,245**|**$708,486**|\n|$ increase||$138,482|$82,845|$229,240|\n|% increase||54.97%|21.22%|48.44%|\n\n# Assets\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Super|$58,227|$97,909|$134,719|$213,047|\n|Equities|$65,517|$59,176|$78,007|$146,269|\n|Property|$217,000|$206,000|$470,000|$762,500|\n|Crypto|$31,754|$56,260|$79,649|$104,036|\n|Cash|$29,607|$122,965|$88,600|$47,722|\n|Car|$9,125|$9,125|$8,000|$6,000|\n|**Total**|**$411,229**|**$551,435**|**$858,976**|**$1,273,574**|\n\n# Debt\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mortgage|$158,500|$154,995|$382,766|$567,200|\n|Credit Card|$810|$6,039|$2,964|$3,888|\n|**Total**|**$159,310**|**$161,034**|**$385,730**|**$571,088**|\n\nn.b.

From 2017 I had been \u2018investing\u2019 in assets with no real plan: penny stocks, single stocks, oil futures, crypto and some thematic ETFs. Clearly had employed zero education and strategy on how to invest in any asset class.\u00a0Had some winners and losers but ended up with a modest CGT bill. The gain pales in comparison to the returns I would have received by buying another IP or investing in my Super and ETFs since 2017 instead.\n\n# 3.2 Getting Educated\n\nIn 2022 I came back from another big, expensive, overseas holiday. I had spent all my cash and a my mix of random assets were in decline. I was again canvasing for some lucrative contracts to fill up the bank account. I knew I had to be more intentional with my money if I wanted to continue this lifestyle of travel and part-time work. I was getting into podcasts at this time and had been writing down a few book titles about investing, personal finance and self-help. So I dove into that!\n\nAfter my learning and finding r/FIAustralia and some other Subreddits I had discovered the 4% guideline and NW calculations. I was surprised to find that my NW was a touch over $250k, albeit spread across a bunch of random asset classes. Seeing that number at 29 years old was really motivating. I knew I could accelerate this journey by earning more. You can see from earnings FY23-FY25 my income increased a lot. I took less holidays but my hourly rate as a locum had also kept increasing. During downtime at work and after hours I spent an obscene amount of time devouring podcasts, books, articles, paid courses, webinars, websites, YT videos, Instagram reels, TikToks and Reddit learning as much as I could about investing, personal finance and property. I sold almost all my random mix of assets back to cash then I came up with my plan:\u00a0Super, property, ETFs, crypto. In that order.\n\n# 3.3 Super Philosophy\n\nI love Super. There is no better tax advantaged way to invest your money for building wealth. Yes Super is locked away until retirement age but that\u2019s the whole point of investing: allowing time to compound your capital by reinvesting the dividends while you add to the pile. By contributing to Super early you are allowing those extra tax dollars saved and contributed capital the longest time possible to compound, tax free!! If something catastrophic happens where I can no longer work and all my money is \u201clocked up\u201d in Super there are early access schemes, income protection, TPD insurance, government welfare programs, other assets, family and friends etc. There are myriad options to support you in the worst-case scenario instead of ignoring Super.\n\nYou really need to take care of yourself for when you\u2019re elderly and too broken to keep working. You do this by jacking your Super to the tits ASAP and then you can start bringing your retirement age back by investing outside of Super.\u00a0If you can\u2019t afford to top your Super up to the current $30k limit after your employer Super Guarantee (SG) you\u2019re probably not earning enough to retire that early anyway. Which means you should definitely prioritise Super. I love [this article](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/how-much-to-save-inside-vs-outside-super/#stages) from\u00a0[PassiveInvestingAustralia.com](http://PassiveInvestingAustralia.com)\u00a0showing how prioritising your Super as an investment will actually help you retire sooner as a low income earner. If you are a high earner you can afford to top up to $30k. You should definitely prioritise Super for the 15% (and 30% DIV293) tax rate which will be miles better than your marginal tax rates. \u00a0\n\n# 3.4 My Super Investment\n\n**$213,046.51** | **31.15% of NW**\n\nHaving the SG since I started working as a casual pharmacy student in 2011 meant I had a good head start on my balance. In 2020 I took out the COVID relief $20k. In hindsight I should have left it in there of course. Especially considering I left it in cash for over 6 months, missing the big V shaped recovery and new all time highs! Oops. In FY23 my income had increased a lot and I was looking for tax deductions. Checking MyGov, I had $90k of unused concessional contributions! I am spreading those tax deductions over 3-4 years to use them up consecutively before they expire after 5 years. I use concessional contributions and salary sacrificing to max my yearly cap and fill up previous unused caps.\n\nThrough my income and investment income in the future I always see myself maxing my contribution limit to Super. I may over invest in Super but I\u2019m not looking to retire ASAP and I plan to give a lot of my wealth away before I die. Investing in Super will give me a huge pot that could help a lot of people! I also plan on maintaining my pharmacy registration over the coming decades. I am required to work an annual 150 hours minimum. Perpetually CoastFI!\n\nI hate that DIV296 tax applies to unrealised gains. I don\u2019t mind taxing Super more above $3m on realised gains though. No one needs that much in Super. Based on my projections I will be close to that balance in 27 years at a traditional retirement age.\n\n# 3.5 Property Philosophy\n\nTalk about a tax deduction: if I love Super, then I\u2019m HORNY FOR PROPERTY! I actually don\u2019t love negative gearing though. Losing money to save your marginal tax rate is an absurd strategy but that's what we're stuck with in Australia. Can\u2019t wait to get my portfolio to neutral territory. I do love to claim the non-cash expenses like depreciation though! Leveraging to buy property is the best way to compound your capital IMO. You have way more control over your assets, can manufacture equity and directly increase the yields. You don\u2019t have that level of finesse over companies in the share market (unless you\u2019re getting a board seat lol). The massive low-cost leverage you can apply to your capital by investing in property makes it a superior investment option to build wealth compared to the light leverage you can get with equities. I think debt recycling is a really sexy strategy too and I can\u2019t wait to utilise that when we buy a home!\n\nThe reason property was second on my list of priorities over ETFs is two-fold, though related. Firstly, with leverage you can control a large dollar value of assets in the market. You want to benefit from the maximum amount of assets growing in the market for the most time possible. Secondly: government mandated inflation at 2-3% erodes the value of the debt. So you need to take on the debt and buy the assets ASAP to allow positive compounding on the largest amount of assets and negative compounding on your debt through inflation! This move was all about time. Maximising the time you control these huge assets with maximum leverage will compound better returns.\n\n# 3.6 My Property Investment\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|IPs|2.5|\n|Total Value|$1,525,000|\n|Total Debt|$1,134,400|\n|Net Value|$390,600|\n|Leverage Ratio|74%|\n|Offset Account|$47,722|\n|**Net Value**|**$438,322**|\n\n# Profit / Loss Statement\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Income|$74,620|\n|Total Expenses|$104,781|\n|Offset Gain Back|$2,983|\n|**Estimated Cashflow before tax**|**\u2013$27,178**|\n|Depreciation|$17,128|\n|Accountant Expense|$2,500|\n|Land Tax|$0|\n|Tax Rate %|39%|\n|**Estimated Cashflow after tax**|**\u2013$11,424**|\n\n# Blended Interest Rate                                                       6.25%\n\n**Equity share of $195 300 is 27.65% of NW.**\n\nIn 2016 I grossly overpaid on a house and land package in a Townsville suburb with lots of developable land AND in a flood zone! I\u2019m very nervous every wet season in NQld. But it didn\u2019t flood in 2019 (just) or during this year\u2019s flood event in March.\u00a0I knew nothing about investing in property evidenced in the fact that I was negative equity until it finally grew enough 8 years later to negate the premium I paid the developer and builder. I built this house with my then gf and still own it 50/50 as tenants in common. I put in $23k cash, she $13k, and we were $405k all in. Current valuation 600k so a pretty poor effort over 8.5 years especially as the growth only came the last 18 months. It is a 7%+ gross yield on purchase now so it has been positively geared last two FYs at least. I plan to add a 4th bedroom by enclosing a 2nd living area to add an estimated 80-90k of equity based on comparables in the suburb and selling it in 2026. I will unlock the equity as cash, get the borrowing capacity back and dissolve the complex loan product I hold over the property with my ex. I need to check with my accountant but I think I can claim the 6 year rule on partial gains up to 2022 as I haven\u2019t claimed another PPOR. I didn\u2019t get it valued at the 6 year mark though so this might prove difficult if it\u2019s even possible!\n\nSecond property was also purchased in Townsville. May \u201824, 10% down at 450k with 5.4% gross yield, cash deposit. Bank valuation this June: 575k!! Third property in Mackay. Purchased September \u201824, 10% down at 570k with 5.02% gross yield cash and equity from property #1. Bank valuation this June: $650k!! So there\u2019s almost 400k of equity in the portfolio ATM. As a pharmacist I can get 90% LVR lend no LMI without being punished on the rates. It\u2019s a great lending product and very happy to be able to take advantage! I am pre-approved for 600k more in my personal name with this loan product. I plan to use this to buy in one of three locations: Lavington, Albury; South Grafton, NSW or Bendigo, VIC. Suburb medians are 500-570k and growing with demand and supply side data metrics looking promising while gross yields of 5%+ are achievable.\n\n# 3.7 Future Property Plans\n\nI\u2019m close to my Qld land tax threshold in my personal name and want to diversify states. WA and SA have had a lot of growth and Victoria has a few investors head winds: They have a low land tax threshold (50k!) and have hostile landlord policies. There\u2019s lots of developable land down that way so will have less of a supply constraint long term compared to other markets.\u00a0There\u2019s still potential for growth but I think there\u2019s better opportunities in NSW and Qld.\n\nGoing forward I will need to utilise trust structures to preserve my borrowing capacity. Broker says I\u2019ll be tapped out with the majors after #4 but I will still be able to lend with 2nd and 3rd tier lenders, especially if I let go of property #1. My 5th purchase is going to be a commercial property. I will then pigeon pair that inside the same trust with another growth property. This will help me pay off the debt of the commercial property in the future while keeping the trust positive through this holding period. The banks can disregard the debt inside that trust if it\u2019s positive cash flow and I can lend again based on my personal capacity. Strategy has been fleshed out with my broker and tax agent. It\u2019s risky obviously but damn I just love leverage.\n\nI don\u2019t have a goal for portfolio size, equity position or cashflow, but looking at growth on a $4.5m assets base in a [Future Value calculator](https://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html?cyearsv=30&cstartingprinciplev=4%2C500%2C000&cinterestratev=5&ccontributeamountv=0&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=Calculate#calresult) looks pretty good to me! Achievable too once I move into commercial property assets where I will be buying in higher price points.\n\n# 3.8 My ETF Investments\n\n**20.71% of NW**\n\n|Ticker|Allocation|Value|Contributions|%ROI|$ROI|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|VGS|61.24%|$89,570|$52,930|69.22%|$36,640|\n|VAS|21.96%|$32,121|$20,291|58.30%|$11,830|\n|GHFF|16.80%|$24,578|$21,879|12.34%|$2,699|\n|**Total**|**100.00%**|**$146,269**|**$95,100**|**53.81%**|**$51,170**|\n\nI\u2019m actually most obsessed with equities. Little bits of money that grow and pay you dividends. The worst thing that happens is they go down in price! Then you can buy more or use the income from the investments to buy more! So accessible, liquid, powerful. It has been third on my list of priorities as I gathered deposits and cashed in on Super deductions. Cashflow can get tight with my Super/Property strategy and I\u2019m not very liquid. So storing cash and extra savings in ETFs is my new drug! It really adds a lot of liquidity and accessible reserves to my portfolio. I burnt myself on some fun thematics like YOLO, ARKK and HCLN over the years. When I sold most of my assets to restructure my finances in 2022 I was down 24k on those. Sold out of my oil futures, single stocks as well (wish I\u2019d kept Palantir!). Went all in on an 80/20 VGS/VAS portfolio. Recently though I have been really excited about GHHF. It has a higher Oz content than I\u2019d like at 37% so I\u2019m continuing to buy VGS as well to keep me within my desired allocation. I haven\u2019t decided yet what ratio I want of leveraged ETFs but if I know myself, it will be as close to 100% as that mathematical asymptote will let me get lol. Leverage is just so sexy the way it juices returns! \u00a0\n\n# 3.9 My Crypto Investments\n\n**$104,036.11** | **14.73% of NW** | **BCH(69%)/BTC(18%)/ETH(13%)**\n\nI am a huge fan of transparent and immutable blockchain technology. It has a lot of applications. I\u2019m still waiting for the killer app, but it isn\u2019t BTC. I bought BTC in 2017 and also sold it in 2017 because it had gone up a lot and\u00a0transactions were congested and fees were so high it was unusable as peer to peer cash. I thought it would crash because it was useless; and still is with high fees and handicapped transaction volume. Big regrets tho lol.\n\nIf you know anything about crypto I didn\u2019t sell before the BCH hard fork at least. So I got all those coins for free! Which forked twice more for BSV and XEC. In 2022 during the great restructuring I sold the latter two hard forks for free money and also 12 shitcoins I had accumulated. I kept all my BCH and add to it regularly. For me it\u2019s the most useful crypto. You can send any amount instantly, peer to peer for less than a cent to anyone, anywhere in the world! The transaction is always confirmed in the next block for immutability. I love it. Couldn\u2019t resist DCAing back into BTC because damn that thing just keeps going up! I also invest in ETH. Crystallised $34k in gains from crypto over the years so Ive only got $24k of capital in my crypto portfolio.\n\nI think there\u2019s a place for crypto in anyone\u2019s portfolio but it has to be about a project you know and think has utility. My allocation is a little high at 14.73% relative to NW. Adding to my other assets will make my crypto allocation a smaller part of my NW over time. I don\u2019t expect the growth to be as explosive going forward so it should balance out soon. Aiming for 10% allocation of my NW.\n\n# 4.0\u00a0Future Plans and Goals\n\nHaving average expenses of <40kpa means I\u2019m not far from my FIRE number! However I expect my spend to increase significantly over the next decade. We will eventually start renting a \u201cdream home\u201d or purchase a PPOR, dial up the spend on travel/hobbies and charitable giving, and setup an awesome camping rig which will have significant ownership costs. I also love a bit of luxury so my FI number is likely much higher. I guess my minimum goal is around $1.5-1.9m which is 60-76kp on a 4% SWR. I still have another 2-3 years of building my property portfolio so will need to continue working full-time for servicing. Then I\u2019m feeling a CoastFI vibe while my assets compound for me. I will work a mandated 150 hours per year minimum to maintain my pharmacy registration and fluctuate my workload as I need. The question I\u2019m mulling over is what does that CoastFI job look like over the coming years?\n\nI could easily stay with this government job as it\u2019s been very relaxing and well paid with free accommodation. The rural site is not my gf\u2019s favourite place though so I probably can\u2019t stay for more than 18 months. Have been keeping an eye on other state health jobs for internal transfer. I could go back to locuming. I have a great network and there\u2019s still plenty of work on but my gf is definitely over it having traveled with me for 4 years! It\u2019s also a more difficult lending landscape for servicing. The other option is getting into a business partnership. Having met dozens of pharmacy owners over the years I have been offered 4 partnerships. Pharmacies usually return 10-15% on owners equity! You need to be a pharmacist to own a pharmacy so there\u2019s less competition to get in. It\u2019s also a protected industry from competitors and both sides of government are pro locally-owned community pharmacies compared to the corporate pharmacy business model you see in the US, for example. It\u2019s an enticing prospect. It would be a challenge and the pay off on the back end will be great into the future. I don\u2019t know if I have it in me though when I can get to where I\u2019m going on my current \u201ceasy\u201d path. Something to contemplate as I learn and grow as a person and an investor!\u00a0\n\n# 5.0 Resources\n\nIf you want a list of resources that I liked the most from my learning I share it regularly in subs.

          "selftext": "I once worked in a call centre position for a \"middle-man\" company that assisted in retaining monthly donors to some major charities (National Breast Cancer Foundation, McGrath Foundation, Seeing Eye Dogs, I forgot the rest but others were also major ones).\n\nAll we would do are 3 minute calls, after you signed up to support a foundation in a shopping centre, verifying your details and clarifying your commitment. At this point, we would be the \"empathetic salesman\" and adjust your donation amount incase you feel you over committed. But again, the goal is retainment.\n\nIn the fine print, that no one ever reads, it says that 97% of your donation for the first 2 years goes to our company and after those 2 years your money goes to the charity itself (I dont recall if that was 100% to the charity or not). Our company operated all across Australia and even started operating the front lines trying to get people signed up. The line they would have to say is, \"The X foundation really does benefit the most from donations of 2 years or more\" and then slap on a slogan at the end which is given to us by the foundation themself. We go by scripts for just about every question you have and the answers are all to entice you to stay donating your money.\n\nFinance wise, even the people who stand in a shopping mall asking you to do monthly donations may not even work directly for that foundation. You are allowed to ask if they get commission (they do), and how much of the money goes to the charity, but that doesn't mean people won't lie.\n\nMore of a moral finance thing than a tax purposes one here. I quite after a month. If you donate directly through their website, you skip all the outside dodgy-ness.",

I graduated a 4 year pharmacy degree in 2013 and interned for a year in 2014 at 22 years old. In 2017 I completed my MBA and also got a cash gift of $20k from my parents. Accrued $58k of HECS debt including $7,300 of indexation that took 10 years to pay off by 2024.\n\n# 1.1 Career Progression\n\nI worked in my home town for 3 years after graduation in a 9-5 before starting locum work in 2017 when my income took off. I was chasing the highest paid contracts in new locations I hadn\u2019t traveled to before. I would cover maternity/paternity contracts, owner/staff annual leave, busy holiday periods etc. This work coupled my thrill of making money with my desire to travel and see new places. I have worked in over 30 towns/cities in Australia and visited/camped in scores more in between contracts. Contracts could range from 2 weeks to 3 months.\n\nI love my job! I\u2019m a huge people person so being able to help people with their minor or major health care needs really makes me fulfilled! I have been very lucky to happen into a profession that I enjoy and has had really good wage growth.\u00a0\n\nIt was tough and stressful working as a contractor for 8 years under an ABN without annual/sick leave: sourcing contracts, negotiating contracts, syncing work calendars with social and personal commitments, living out of a cars and suitcases, driving thousands of kilometres to new jobs, difficult lending landscape, lumpy income, being away from friends and family etc. But the money was far better compared to working a regular pharmacy job. Being hourly I also maxed my workload while on contract so would routinely average 55 to 60 hours per week depending on the contract.\n\n# 1.2 Current Role\n\nIn 2025 my position is with a state government: $155k including 12.75% super. I received a $30k sign on bonus and will get a $20k retention bonus at 12 & 24 months. Accommodation is included as the location is a rural site. I work 38h Monday - Friday with an unpaid hour for lunch! The new work/life balance was great for 2 months. Then I started locuming on weekends because I\u2019m addicted to the hourly rate! Currently working 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on a Sunday for $110/h gross. So I\u2019m 52h/week across 7 days which is manageable but I (mostly my gf) would really like a day off. I\u2019m currently looking at dropping my two weekend shifts and negotiating a 14 hour shift on a Saturday at a new pharmacy for the $110/h rate! Same 52h but across 6 days. Perfect.\n\n# 2.0 Expenses and Savings Rate\n\n|Item|FY '22|FY '23|FY '24|FY '25|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Expenses**|**$38,906**|**$28,097**|**$35,143**|**$36,944**|\n|Debits|$7,391|$9,140|$3,556|$76|\n|Credit Card|$5,184|$9,207|$9,561|$19,631|\n|Joint A/c|$6,704|$9,750|$8,809|$6,481|\n|Int\u2019 Travel|$19,627|$0|$13,217|$10,756|\n||||||\n|**Post-tax SR**|**23.3%**|**77.8%**|**75.7%**|**76.3%**|\n\n# 2.1 Expenses in my 20s\n\nThrough uni (2010-2013) I worked casually at a pharmacy. Was paid quite a bit for an 18-21 year old pharmacy student so was pretty happy! Never really saved anything or invested at this stage. Lucky to live at home through my uni degree rent free. Spent all my cash buying 3 progressively more expensive second hand cars over 5 years which all needed hella repairs. Spent the rest of my money on house hold goods, food, booze, partying, drugs, domestic travel, dating, fashion, whatever. When I started working my pharmacy internship in 2014 I was paying $150/w in rent to my parents. This continued until I moved out in 2016 and had a mortgage with adult bills. Wasn\u2019t much left over after budgeting for bills and mortgage. You can see my income that year took a big dip! Was paid far more as a student than an intern!\n\n# 2.2 Adult Expenses\n\n2017 you can see my income increased a lot when I started locum work. So of course I dialled up the spend! I\u2019d converted my PPOR to an IP as I left my home town to start work on the road. So from 2017 until January 2025 I have never paid rent or a PPOR mortgage repayment. I negotiated contracts with employers to cover accommodation and usually travel costs. Sometimes it was caravan parks or motels, sometimes AirBnBs, the owner\u2019s homes or hotels. In between contracts we camp, stay with friends/family, overseas travel or book domestic accommodation. Currently I split $250/w with my gf for a room in a city I travel to for work on weekends. Having very little housing costs obviously has kept my living expenses extremely low. Not feasible forever but great to help me increase my savings rate and get a head start on investing.\n\nFortunate to have met my partner traveling in 2019 who was also on board with FI! This year she is now CoastFI on her overseas assets. We share all our living and travel expenses through a joint bank account we contribute to equally. I apportion the property portfolio equity, debt and cashflow 50/50 with her in our individual NW numbers. We have and will continue to use a mix of our cash for deposits and expenses. In the event of a breakup we will split the property assets 50/50 after paying out our individual contributions and cash in the offsets. All our other assets are separate.\n\n# 2.3 Savings Rate\n\nI keep spending pretty tight these days but I LOVE paying for convenience. I love not having to be stressed about the price of catching an Uber/Taxi, price of groceries, or buying/replacing something that I want when I need it. I don\u2019t bother tracking my spending too closely. I do have a budget that I update every year with my big known expenses and guestimates for fuel, food and discretionary spending etc but I don\u2019t reconcile it. The budgeted expenses come out pretty close to my top line spend in my Expenses/SR table so I don\u2019t feel the need to get more granular. The only thing I itemise further is international travel because that\u2019s a big part of my FI life! Savings rate has been >70% since I\u2019ve been living life thru the FI lens so I CBFd scrutinising my expenses any further.\n\n# 2.4 Lifestyle Creep\n\nI do love dropping a bomb on holidays though! 2018/19 spent $20.2k in SE Asia for 9 months meeting my gf at the end of it. 2022 I spent $19.6k on 4 months across 8 US states and Brazil. 2024 I spent $13.2k on 10 weeks in South America. 2025 I spent $10.7k on 4 weeks in the US.\u00a0\n\nAlready we've inflated our travel lifestyle by booking Airbnbs/hotels in our desired areas instead of hostels in a cheaper location. We book flights with convenient departure/arrival times even if they're more expensive. We have a spend-like-we\u2019re-rich rule on holiday to help us really enjoy ourselves. I'd love to be in a position to travel more often, upgrade to business class for flights >5 hours, dial up the luxury a lil in the accommodation we book, travel to more expensive locations, hire a private driver/tour guide, ball out on experiences in incredible locations etc. The lifestyle creep will come easy so I need to grow my NW to support the spend I want to have.\n\n# 3.0 Investing\n\n# Net Worth Summary\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Net Worth**|**$251,919**|**$390,401**|**$473,245**|**$708,486**|\n|$ increase||$138,482|$82,845|$229,240|\n|% increase||54.97%|21.22%|48.44%|\n\n# Assets\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Super|$58,227|$97,909|$134,719|$213,047|\n|Equities|$65,517|$59,176|$78,007|$146,269|\n|Property|$217,000|$206,000|$470,000|$762,500|\n|Crypto|$31,754|$56,260|$79,649|$104,036|\n|Cash|$29,607|$122,965|$88,600|$47,722|\n|Car|$9,125|$9,125|$8,000|$6,000|\n|**Total**|**$411,229**|**$551,435**|**$858,976**|**$1,273,574**|\n\n# Debt\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mortgage|$158,500|$154,995|$382,766|$567,200|\n|Credit Card|$810|$6,039|$2,964|$3,888|\n|**Total**|**$159,310**|**$161,034**|**$385,730**|**$571,088**|\n\nn.b.

From 2017 I had been \u2018investing\u2019 in assets with no real plan: penny stocks, single stocks, oil futures, crypto and some thematic ETFs. Clearly had employed zero education and strategy on how to invest in any asset class.\u00a0Had some winners and losers but ended up with a modest CGT bill. The gain pales in comparison to the returns I would have received by buying another IP or investing in my Super and ETFs since 2017 instead.\n\n# 3.2 Getting Educated\n\nIn 2022 I came back from another big, expensive, overseas holiday. I had spent all my cash and a my mix of random assets were in decline. I was again canvasing for some lucrative contracts to fill up the bank account. I knew I had to be more intentional with my money if I wanted to continue this lifestyle of travel and part-time work. I was getting into podcasts at this time and had been writing down a few book titles about investing, personal finance and self-help. So I dove into that!\n\nAfter my learning and finding r/FIAustralia and some other Subreddits I had discovered the 4% guideline and NW calculations. I was surprised to find that my NW was a touch over $250k, albeit spread across a bunch of random asset classes. Seeing that number at 29 years old was really motivating. I knew I could accelerate this journey by earning more. You can see from earnings FY23-FY25 my income increased a lot. I took less holidays but my hourly rate as a locum had also kept increasing. During downtime at work and after hours I spent an obscene amount of time devouring podcasts, books, articles, paid courses, webinars, websites, YT videos, Instagram reels, TikToks and Reddit learning as much as I could about investing, personal finance and property. I sold almost all my random mix of assets back to cash then I came up with my plan:\u00a0Super, property, ETFs, crypto. In that order.\n\n# 3.3 Super Philosophy\n\nI love Super. There is no better tax advantaged way to invest your money for building wealth. Yes Super is locked away until retirement age but that\u2019s the whole point of investing: allowing time to compound your capital by reinvesting the dividends while you add to the pile. By contributing to Super early you are allowing those extra tax dollars saved and contributed capital the longest time possible to compound, tax free!! If something catastrophic happens where I can no longer work and all my money is \u201clocked up\u201d in Super there are early access schemes, income protection, TPD insurance, government welfare programs, other assets, family and friends etc. There are myriad options to support you in the worst-case scenario instead of ignoring Super.\n\nYou really need to take care of yourself for when you\u2019re elderly and too broken to keep working. You do this by jacking your Super to the tits ASAP and then you can start bringing your retirement age back by investing outside of Super.\u00a0If you can\u2019t afford to top your Super up to the current $30k limit after your employer Super Guarantee (SG) you\u2019re probably not earning enough to retire that early anyway. Which means you should definitely prioritise Super. I love [this article](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/how-much-to-save-inside-vs-outside-super/#stages) from\u00a0[PassiveInvestingAustralia.com](http://PassiveInvestingAustralia.com)\u00a0showing how prioritising your Super as an investment will actually help you retire sooner as a low income earner. If you are a high earner you can afford to top up to $30k. You should definitely prioritise Super for the 15% (and 30% DIV293) tax rate which will be miles better than your marginal tax rates. \u00a0\n\n# 3.4 My Super Investment\n\n**$213,046.51** | **31.15% of NW**\n\nHaving the SG since I started working as a casual pharmacy student in 2011 meant I had a good head start on my balance. In 2020 I took out the COVID relief $20k. In hindsight I should have left it in there of course. Especially considering I left it in cash for over 6 months, missing the big V shaped recovery and new all time highs! Oops. In FY23 my income had increased a lot and I was looking for tax deductions. Checking MyGov, I had $90k of unused concessional contributions! I am spreading those tax deductions over 3-4 years to use them up consecutively before they expire after 5 years. I use concessional contributions and salary sacrificing to max my yearly cap and fill up previous unused caps.\n\nThrough my income and investment income in the future I always see myself maxing my contribution limit to Super. I may over invest in Super but I\u2019m not looking to retire ASAP and I plan to give a lot of my wealth away before I die. Investing in Super will give me a huge pot that could help a lot of people! I also plan on maintaining my pharmacy registration over the coming decades. I am required to work an annual 150 hours minimum. Perpetually CoastFI!\n\nI hate that DIV296 tax applies to unrealised gains. I don\u2019t mind taxing Super more above $3m on realised gains though. No one needs that much in Super. Based on my projections I will be close to that balance in 27 years at a traditional retirement age.\n\n# 3.5 Property Philosophy\n\nTalk about a tax deduction: if I love Super, then I\u2019m HORNY FOR PROPERTY! I actually don\u2019t love negative gearing though. Losing money to save your marginal tax rate is an absurd strategy but that's what we're stuck with in Australia. Can\u2019t wait to get my portfolio to neutral territory. I do love to claim the non-cash expenses like depreciation though! Leveraging to buy property is the best way to compound your capital IMO. You have way more control over your assets, can manufacture equity and directly increase the yields. You don\u2019t have that level of finesse over companies in the share market (unless you\u2019re getting a board seat lol). The massive low-cost leverage you can apply to your capital by investing in property makes it a superior investment option to build wealth compared to the light leverage you can get with equities. I think debt recycling is a really sexy strategy too and I can\u2019t wait to utilise that when we buy a home!\n\nThe reason property was second on my list of priorities over ETFs is two-fold, though related. Firstly, with leverage you can control a large dollar value of assets in the market. You want to benefit from the maximum amount of assets growing in the market for the most time possible. Secondly: government mandated inflation at 2-3% erodes the value of the debt. So you need to take on the debt and buy the assets ASAP to allow positive compounding on the largest amount of assets and negative compounding on your debt through inflation! This move was all about time. Maximising the time you control these huge assets with maximum leverage will compound better returns.\n\n# 3.6 My Property Investment\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|IPs|2.5|\n|Total Value|$1,525,000|\n|Total Debt|$1,134,400|\n|Net Value|$390,600|\n|Leverage Ratio|74%|\n|Offset Account|$47,722|\n|**Net Value**|**$438,322**|\n\n# Profit / Loss Statement\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Income|$74,620|\n|Total Expenses|$104,781|\n|Offset Gain Back|$2,983|\n|**Estimated Cashflow before tax**|**\u2013$27,178**|\n|Depreciation|$17,128|\n|Accountant Expense|$2,500|\n|Land Tax|$0|\n|Tax Rate %|39%|\n|**Estimated Cashflow after tax**|**\u2013$11,424**|\n\n# Blended Interest Rate                                                       6.25%\n\n**Equity share of $195 300 is 27.65% of NW.**\n\nIn 2016 I grossly overpaid on a house and land package in a Townsville suburb with lots of developable land AND in a flood zone! I\u2019m very nervous every wet season in NQld. But it didn\u2019t flood in 2019 (just) or during this year\u2019s flood event in March.\u00a0I knew nothing about investing in property evidenced in the fact that I was negative equity until it finally grew enough 8 years later to negate the premium I paid the developer and builder. I built this house with my then gf and still own it 50/50 as tenants in common. I put in $23k cash, she $13k, and we were $405k all in. Current valuation 600k so a pretty poor effort over 8.5 years especially as the growth only came the last 18 months. It is a 7%+ gross yield on purchase now so it has been positively geared last two FYs at least. I plan to add a 4th bedroom by enclosing a 2nd living area to add an estimated 80-90k of equity based on comparables in the suburb and selling it in 2026. I will unlock the equity as cash, get the borrowing capacity back and dissolve the complex loan product I hold over the property with my ex. I need to check with my accountant but I think I can claim the 6 year rule on partial gains up to 2022 as I haven\u2019t claimed another PPOR. I didn\u2019t get it valued at the 6 year mark though so this might prove difficult if it\u2019s even possible!\n\nSecond property was also purchased in Townsville. May \u201824, 10% down at 450k with 5.4% gross yield, cash deposit. Bank valuation this June: 575k!! Third property in Mackay. Purchased September \u201824, 10% down at 570k with 5.02% gross yield cash and equity from property #1. Bank valuation this June: $650k!! So there\u2019s almost 400k of equity in the portfolio ATM. As a pharmacist I can get 90% LVR lend no LMI without being punished on the rates. It\u2019s a great lending product and very happy to be able to take advantage! I am pre-approved for 600k more in my personal name with this loan product. I plan to use this to buy in one of three locations: Lavington, Albury; South Grafton, NSW or Bendigo, VIC. Suburb medians are 500-570k and growing with demand and supply side data metrics looking promising while gross yields of 5%+ are achievable.\n\n# 3.7 Future Property Plans\n\nI\u2019m close to my Qld land tax threshold in my personal name and want to diversify states. WA and SA have had a lot of growth and Victoria has a few investors head winds: They have a low land tax threshold (50k!) and have hostile landlord policies. There\u2019s lots of developable land down that way so will have less of a supply constraint long term compared to other markets.\u00a0There\u2019s still potential for growth but I think there\u2019s better opportunities in NSW and Qld.\n\nGoing forward I will need to utilise trust structures to preserve my borrowing capacity. Broker says I\u2019ll be tapped out with the majors after #4 but I will still be able to lend with 2nd and 3rd tier lenders, especially if I let go of property #1. My 5th purchase is going to be a commercial property. I will then pigeon pair that inside the same trust with another growth property. This will help me pay off the debt of the commercial property in the future while keeping the trust positive through this holding period. The banks can disregard the debt inside that trust if it\u2019s positive cash flow and I can lend again based on my personal capacity. Strategy has been fleshed out with my broker and tax agent. It\u2019s risky obviously but damn I just love leverage.\n\nI don\u2019t have a goal for portfolio size, equity position or cashflow, but looking at growth on a $4.5m assets base in a [Future Value calculator](https://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html?cyearsv=30&cstartingprinciplev=4%2C500%2C000&cinterestratev=5&ccontributeamountv=0&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=Calculate#calresult) looks pretty good to me! Achievable too once I move into commercial property assets where I will be buying in higher price points.\n\n# 3.8 My ETF Investments\n\n**20.71% of NW**\n\n|Ticker|Allocation|Value|Contributions|%ROI|$ROI|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|VGS|61.24%|$89,570|$52,930|69.22%|$36,640|\n|VAS|21.96%|$32,121|$20,291|58.30%|$11,830|\n|GHFF|16.80%|$24,578|$21,879|12.34%|$2,699|\n|**Total**|**100.00%**|**$146,269**|**$95,100**|**53.81%**|**$51,170**|\n\nI\u2019m actually most obsessed with equities. Little bits of money that grow and pay you dividends. The worst thing that happens is they go down in price! Then you can buy more or use the income from the investments to buy more! So accessible, liquid, powerful. It has been third on my list of priorities as I gathered deposits and cashed in on Super deductions. Cashflow can get tight with my Super/Property strategy and I\u2019m not very liquid. So storing cash and extra savings in ETFs is my new drug! It really adds a lot of liquidity and accessible reserves to my portfolio. I burnt myself on some fun thematics like YOLO, ARKK and HCLN over the years. When I sold most of my assets to restructure my finances in 2022 I was down 24k on those. Sold out of my oil futures, single stocks as well (wish I\u2019d kept Palantir!). Went all in on an 80/20 VGS/VAS portfolio. Recently though I have been really excited about GHHF. It has a higher Oz content than I\u2019d like at 37% so I\u2019m continuing to buy VGS as well to keep me within my desired allocation. I haven\u2019t decided yet what ratio I want of leveraged ETFs but if I know myself, it will be as close to 100% as that mathematical asymptote will let me get lol. Leverage is just so sexy the way it juices returns! \u00a0\n\n# 3.9 My Crypto Investments\n\n**$104,036.11** | **14.73% of NW** | **BCH(69%)/BTC(18%)/ETH(13%)**\n\nI am a huge fan of transparent and immutable blockchain technology. It has a lot of applications. I\u2019m still waiting for the killer app, but it isn\u2019t BTC. I bought BTC in 2017 and also sold it in 2017 because it had gone up a lot and\u00a0transactions were congested and fees were so high it was unusable as peer to peer cash. I thought it would crash because it was useless; and still is with high fees and handicapped transaction volume. Big regrets tho lol.\n\nIf you know anything about crypto I didn\u2019t sell before the BCH hard fork at least. So I got all those coins for free! Which forked twice more for BSV and XEC. In 2022 during the great restructuring I sold the latter two hard forks for free money and also 12 shitcoins I had accumulated. I kept all my BCH and add to it regularly. For me it\u2019s the most useful crypto. You can send any amount instantly, peer to peer for less than a cent to anyone, anywhere in the world! The transaction is always confirmed in the next block for immutability. I love it. Couldn\u2019t resist DCAing back into BTC because damn that thing just keeps going up! I also invest in ETH. Crystallised $34k in gains from crypto over the years so Ive only got $24k of capital in my crypto portfolio.\n\nI think there\u2019s a place for crypto in anyone\u2019s portfolio but it has to be about a project you know and think has utility. My allocation is a little high at 14.73% relative to NW. Adding to my other assets will make my crypto allocation a smaller part of my NW over time. I don\u2019t expect the growth to be as explosive going forward so it should balance out soon. Aiming for 10% allocation of my NW.\n\n# 4.0\u00a0Future Plans and Goals\n\nHaving average expenses of <40kpa means I\u2019m not far from my FIRE number! However I expect my spend to increase significantly over the next decade. We will eventually start renting a \u201cdream home\u201d or purchase a PPOR, dial up the spend on travel/hobbies and charitable giving, and setup an awesome camping rig which will have significant ownership costs. I also love a bit of luxury so my FI number is likely much higher. I guess my minimum goal is around $1.5-1.9m which is 60-76kp on a 4% SWR. I still have another 2-3 years of building my property portfolio so will need to continue working full-time for servicing. Then I\u2019m feeling a CoastFI vibe while my assets compound for me. I will work a mandated 150 hours per year minimum to maintain my pharmacy registration and fluctuate my workload as I need. The question I\u2019m mulling over is what does that CoastFI job look like over the coming years?\n\nI could easily stay with this government job as it\u2019s been very relaxing and well paid with free accommodation. The rural site is not my gf\u2019s favourite place though so I probably can\u2019t stay for more than 18 months. Have been keeping an eye on other state health jobs for internal transfer. I could go back to locuming. I have a great network and there\u2019s still plenty of work on but my gf is definitely over it having traveled with me for 4 years! It\u2019s also a more difficult lending landscape for servicing. The other option is getting into a business partnership. Having met dozens of pharmacy owners over the years I have been offered 4 partnerships. Pharmacies usually return 10-15% on owners equity! You need to be a pharmacist to own a pharmacy so there\u2019s less competition to get in. It\u2019s also a protected industry from competitors and both sides of government are pro locally-owned community pharmacies compared to the corporate pharmacy business model you see in the US, for example. It\u2019s an enticing prospect. It would be a challenge and the pay off on the back end will be great into the future. I don\u2019t know if I have it in me though when I can get to where I\u2019m going on my current \u201ceasy\u201d path. Something to contemplate as I learn and grow as a person and an investor!\u00a0\n\n# 5.0 Resources\n\nIf you want a list of resources that I liked the most from my learning I share it regularly in subs.

          "selftext": "I once worked in a call centre position for a \"middle-man\" company that assisted in retaining monthly donors to some major charities (National Breast Cancer Foundation, McGrath Foundation, Seeing Eye Dogs, I forgot the rest but others were also major ones).\n\nAll we would do are 3 minute calls, after you signed up to support a foundation in a shopping centre, verifying your details and clarifying your commitment. At this point, we would be the \"empathetic salesman\" and adjust your donation amount incase you feel you over committed. But again, the goal is retainment.\n\nIn the fine print, that no one ever reads, it says that 97% of your donation for the first 2 years goes to our company and after those 2 years your money goes to the charity itself (I dont recall if that was 100% to the charity or not). Our company operated all across Australia and even started operating the front lines trying to get people signed up. The line they would have to say is, \"The X foundation really does benefit the most from donations of 2 years or more\" and then slap on a slogan at the end which is given to us by the foundation themself. We go by scripts for just about every question you have and the answers are all to entice you to stay donating your money.\n\nFinance wise, even the people who stand in a shopping mall asking you to do monthly donations may not even work directly for that foundation. You are allowed to ask if they get commission (they do), and how much of the money goes to the charity, but that doesn't mean people won't lie.\n\nMore of a moral finance thing than a tax purposes one here. I quite after a month. If you donate directly through their website, you skip all the outside dodgy-ness.",

They tried $4500, but the bank blocked them. I checked the BSB of the account it went to, and it's another NAB account located on the south coast of NSW (I'm in Newcastle).\n\nThe bank operator said the chances of the money being returned are very slim.\n\nIt's all very strange. I have SMS 2-factor set up and didn't receive any sms during the night asking for a code for a new login, etc. I assume ive had a password leak during a hack.\n\nThe bank said it's from an IP similar to mine but located in Sydney. I would never log into my bank on an unknown computer, and 95% access my bank using my phone. \n\nI thought they could have gotten access through my Google account, but ive checked the activity logs and there has been nothing through my Google account from when I went to bed until I woke up. \n\nA bit concerned. Has anyone else experienced this and can offer some advice? \n\nThank you",

I graduated a 4 year pharmacy degree in 2013 and interned for a year in 2014 at 22 years old. In 2017 I completed my MBA and also got a cash gift of $20k from my parents. Accrued $58k of HECS debt including $7,300 of indexation that took 10 years to pay off by 2024.\n\n# 1.1 Career Progression\n\nI worked in my home town for 3 years after graduation in a 9-5 before starting locum work in 2017 when my income took off. I was chasing the highest paid contracts in new locations I hadn\u2019t traveled to before. I would cover maternity/paternity contracts, owner/staff annual leave, busy holiday periods etc. This work coupled my thrill of making money with my desire to travel and see new places. I have worked in over 30 towns/cities in Australia and visited/camped in scores more in between contracts. Contracts could range from 2 weeks to 3 months.\n\nI love my job! I\u2019m a huge people person so being able to help people with their minor or major health care needs really makes me fulfilled! I have been very lucky to happen into a profession that I enjoy and has had really good wage growth.\u00a0\n\nIt was tough and stressful working as a contractor for 8 years under an ABN without annual/sick leave: sourcing contracts, negotiating contracts, syncing work calendars with social and personal commitments, living out of a cars and suitcases, driving thousands of kilometres to new jobs, difficult lending landscape, lumpy income, being away from friends and family etc. But the money was far better compared to working a regular pharmacy job. Being hourly I also maxed my workload while on contract so would routinely average 55 to 60 hours per week depending on the contract.\n\n# 1.2 Current Role\n\nIn 2025 my position is with a state government: $155k including 12.75% super. I received a $30k sign on bonus and will get a $20k retention bonus at 12 & 24 months. Accommodation is included as the location is a rural site. I work 38h Monday - Friday with an unpaid hour for lunch! The new work/life balance was great for 2 months. Then I started locuming on weekends because I\u2019m addicted to the hourly rate! Currently working 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on a Sunday for $110/h gross. So I\u2019m 52h/week across 7 days which is manageable but I (mostly my gf) would really like a day off. I\u2019m currently looking at dropping my two weekend shifts and negotiating a 14 hour shift on a Saturday at a new pharmacy for the $110/h rate! Same 52h but across 6 days. Perfect.\n\n# 2.0 Expenses and Savings Rate\n\n|Item|FY '22|FY '23|FY '24|FY '25|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Expenses**|**$38,906**|**$28,097**|**$35,143**|**$36,944**|\n|Debits|$7,391|$9,140|$3,556|$76|\n|Credit Card|$5,184|$9,207|$9,561|$19,631|\n|Joint A/c|$6,704|$9,750|$8,809|$6,481|\n|Int\u2019 Travel|$19,627|$0|$13,217|$10,756|\n||||||\n|**Post-tax SR**|**23.3%**|**77.8%**|**75.7%**|**76.3%**|\n\n# 2.1 Expenses in my 20s\n\nThrough uni (2010-2013) I worked casually at a pharmacy. Was paid quite a bit for an 18-21 year old pharmacy student so was pretty happy! Never really saved anything or invested at this stage. Lucky to live at home through my uni degree rent free. Spent all my cash buying 3 progressively more expensive second hand cars over 5 years which all needed hella repairs. Spent the rest of my money on house hold goods, food, booze, partying, drugs, domestic travel, dating, fashion, whatever. When I started working my pharmacy internship in 2014 I was paying $150/w in rent to my parents. This continued until I moved out in 2016 and had a mortgage with adult bills. Wasn\u2019t much left over after budgeting for bills and mortgage. You can see my income that year took a big dip! Was paid far more as a student than an intern!\n\n# 2.2 Adult Expenses\n\n2017 you can see my income increased a lot when I started locum work. So of course I dialled up the spend! I\u2019d converted my PPOR to an IP as I left my home town to start work on the road. So from 2017 until January 2025 I have never paid rent or a PPOR mortgage repayment. I negotiated contracts with employers to cover accommodation and usually travel costs. Sometimes it was caravan parks or motels, sometimes AirBnBs, the owner\u2019s homes or hotels. In between contracts we camp, stay with friends/family, overseas travel or book domestic accommodation. Currently I split $250/w with my gf for a room in a city I travel to for work on weekends. Having very little housing costs obviously has kept my living expenses extremely low. Not feasible forever but great to help me increase my savings rate and get a head start on investing.\n\nFortunate to have met my partner traveling in 2019 who was also on board with FI! This year she is now CoastFI on her overseas assets. We share all our living and travel expenses through a joint bank account we contribute to equally. I apportion the property portfolio equity, debt and cashflow 50/50 with her in our individual NW numbers. We have and will continue to use a mix of our cash for deposits and expenses. In the event of a breakup we will split the property assets 50/50 after paying out our individual contributions and cash in the offsets. All our other assets are separate.\n\n# 2.3 Savings Rate\n\nI keep spending pretty tight these days but I LOVE paying for convenience. I love not having to be stressed about the price of catching an Uber/Taxi, price of groceries, or buying/replacing something that I want when I need it. I don\u2019t bother tracking my spending too closely. I do have a budget that I update every year with my big known expenses and guestimates for fuel, food and discretionary spending etc but I don\u2019t reconcile it. The budgeted expenses come out pretty close to my top line spend in my Expenses/SR table so I don\u2019t feel the need to get more granular. The only thing I itemise further is international travel because that\u2019s a big part of my FI life! Savings rate has been >70% since I\u2019ve been living life thru the FI lens so I CBFd scrutinising my expenses any further.\n\n# 2.4 Lifestyle Creep\n\nI do love dropping a bomb on holidays though! 2018/19 spent $20.2k in SE Asia for 9 months meeting my gf at the end of it. 2022 I spent $19.6k on 4 months across 8 US states and Brazil. 2024 I spent $13.2k on 10 weeks in South America. 2025 I spent $10.7k on 4 weeks in the US.\u00a0\n\nAlready we've inflated our travel lifestyle by booking Airbnbs/hotels in our desired areas instead of hostels in a cheaper location. We book flights with convenient departure/arrival times even if they're more expensive. We have a spend-like-we\u2019re-rich rule on holiday to help us really enjoy ourselves. I'd love to be in a position to travel more often, upgrade to business class for flights >5 hours, dial up the luxury a lil in the accommodation we book, travel to more expensive locations, hire a private driver/tour guide, ball out on experiences in incredible locations etc. The lifestyle creep will come easy so I need to grow my NW to support the spend I want to have.\n\n# 3.0 Investing\n\n# Net Worth Summary\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Net Worth**|**$251,919**|**$390,401**|**$473,245**|**$708,486**|\n|$ increase||$138,482|$82,845|$229,240|\n|% increase||54.97%|21.22%|48.44%|\n\n# Assets\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Super|$58,227|$97,909|$134,719|$213,047|\n|Equities|$65,517|$59,176|$78,007|$146,269|\n|Property|$217,000|$206,000|$470,000|$762,500|\n|Crypto|$31,754|$56,260|$79,649|$104,036|\n|Cash|$29,607|$122,965|$88,600|$47,722|\n|Car|$9,125|$9,125|$8,000|$6,000|\n|**Total**|**$411,229**|**$551,435**|**$858,976**|**$1,273,574**|\n\n# Debt\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mortgage|$158,500|$154,995|$382,766|$567,200|\n|Credit Card|$810|$6,039|$2,964|$3,888|\n|**Total**|**$159,310**|**$161,034**|**$385,730**|**$571,088**|\n\nn.b.

From 2017 I had been \u2018investing\u2019 in assets with no real plan: penny stocks, single stocks, oil futures, crypto and some thematic ETFs. Clearly had employed zero education and strategy on how to invest in any asset class.\u00a0Had some winners and losers but ended up with a modest CGT bill. The gain pales in comparison to the returns I would have received by buying another IP or investing in my Super and ETFs since 2017 instead.\n\n# 3.2 Getting Educated\n\nIn 2022 I came back from another big, expensive, overseas holiday. I had spent all my cash and a my mix of random assets were in decline. I was again canvasing for some lucrative contracts to fill up the bank account. I knew I had to be more intentional with my money if I wanted to continue this lifestyle of travel and part-time work. I was getting into podcasts at this time and had been writing down a few book titles about investing, personal finance and self-help. So I dove into that!\n\nAfter my learning and finding r/FIAustralia and some other Subreddits I had discovered the 4% guideline and NW calculations. I was surprised to find that my NW was a touch over $250k, albeit spread across a bunch of random asset classes. Seeing that number at 29 years old was really motivating. I knew I could accelerate this journey by earning more. You can see from earnings FY23-FY25 my income increased a lot. I took less holidays but my hourly rate as a locum had also kept increasing. During downtime at work and after hours I spent an obscene amount of time devouring podcasts, books, articles, paid courses, webinars, websites, YT videos, Instagram reels, TikToks and Reddit learning as much as I could about investing, personal finance and property. I sold almost all my random mix of assets back to cash then I came up with my plan:\u00a0Super, property, ETFs, crypto. In that order.\n\n# 3.3 Super Philosophy\n\nI love Super. There is no better tax advantaged way to invest your money for building wealth. Yes Super is locked away until retirement age but that\u2019s the whole point of investing: allowing time to compound your capital by reinvesting the dividends while you add to the pile. By contributing to Super early you are allowing those extra tax dollars saved and contributed capital the longest time possible to compound, tax free!! If something catastrophic happens where I can no longer work and all my money is \u201clocked up\u201d in Super there are early access schemes, income protection, TPD insurance, government welfare programs, other assets, family and friends etc. There are myriad options to support you in the worst-case scenario instead of ignoring Super.\n\nYou really need to take care of yourself for when you\u2019re elderly and too broken to keep working. You do this by jacking your Super to the tits ASAP and then you can start bringing your retirement age back by investing outside of Super.\u00a0If you can\u2019t afford to top your Super up to the current $30k limit after your employer Super Guarantee (SG) you\u2019re probably not earning enough to retire that early anyway. Which means you should definitely prioritise Super. I love [this article](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/how-much-to-save-inside-vs-outside-super/#stages) from\u00a0[PassiveInvestingAustralia.com](http://PassiveInvestingAustralia.com)\u00a0showing how prioritising your Super as an investment will actually help you retire sooner as a low income earner. If you are a high earner you can afford to top up to $30k. You should definitely prioritise Super for the 15% (and 30% DIV293) tax rate which will be miles better than your marginal tax rates. \u00a0\n\n# 3.4 My Super Investment\n\n**$213,046.51** | **31.15% of NW**\n\nHaving the SG since I started working as a casual pharmacy student in 2011 meant I had a good head start on my balance. In 2020 I took out the COVID relief $20k. In hindsight I should have left it in there of course. Especially considering I left it in cash for over 6 months, missing the big V shaped recovery and new all time highs! Oops. In FY23 my income had increased a lot and I was looking for tax deductions. Checking MyGov, I had $90k of unused concessional contributions! I am spreading those tax deductions over 3-4 years to use them up consecutively before they expire after 5 years. I use concessional contributions and salary sacrificing to max my yearly cap and fill up previous unused caps.\n\nThrough my income and investment income in the future I always see myself maxing my contribution limit to Super. I may over invest in Super but I\u2019m not looking to retire ASAP and I plan to give a lot of my wealth away before I die. Investing in Super will give me a huge pot that could help a lot of people! I also plan on maintaining my pharmacy registration over the coming decades. I am required to work an annual 150 hours minimum. Perpetually CoastFI!\n\nI hate that DIV296 tax applies to unrealised gains. I don\u2019t mind taxing Super more above $3m on realised gains though. No one needs that much in Super. Based on my projections I will be close to that balance in 27 years at a traditional retirement age.\n\n# 3.5 Property Philosophy\n\nTalk about a tax deduction: if I love Super, then I\u2019m HORNY FOR PROPERTY! I actually don\u2019t love negative gearing though. Losing money to save your marginal tax rate is an absurd strategy but that's what we're stuck with in Australia. Can\u2019t wait to get my portfolio to neutral territory. I do love to claim the non-cash expenses like depreciation though! Leveraging to buy property is the best way to compound your capital IMO. You have way more control over your assets, can manufacture equity and directly increase the yields. You don\u2019t have that level of finesse over companies in the share market (unless you\u2019re getting a board seat lol). The massive low-cost leverage you can apply to your capital by investing in property makes it a superior investment option to build wealth compared to the light leverage you can get with equities. I think debt recycling is a really sexy strategy too and I can\u2019t wait to utilise that when we buy a home!\n\nThe reason property was second on my list of priorities over ETFs is two-fold, though related. Firstly, with leverage you can control a large dollar value of assets in the market. You want to benefit from the maximum amount of assets growing in the market for the most time possible. Secondly: government mandated inflation at 2-3% erodes the value of the debt. So you need to take on the debt and buy the assets ASAP to allow positive compounding on the largest amount of assets and negative compounding on your debt through inflation! This move was all about time. Maximising the time you control these huge assets with maximum leverage will compound better returns.\n\n# 3.6 My Property Investment\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|IPs|2.5|\n|Total Value|$1,525,000|\n|Total Debt|$1,134,400|\n|Net Value|$390,600|\n|Leverage Ratio|74%|\n|Offset Account|$47,722|\n|**Net Value**|**$438,322**|\n\n# Profit / Loss Statement\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Income|$74,620|\n|Total Expenses|$104,781|\n|Offset Gain Back|$2,983|\n|**Estimated Cashflow before tax**|**\u2013$27,178**|\n|Depreciation|$17,128|\n|Accountant Expense|$2,500|\n|Land Tax|$0|\n|Tax Rate %|39%|\n|**Estimated Cashflow after tax**|**\u2013$11,424**|\n\n# Blended Interest Rate                                                       6.25%\n\n**Equity share of $195 300 is 27.65% of NW.**\n\nIn 2016 I grossly overpaid on a house and land package in a Townsville suburb with lots of developable land AND in a flood zone! I\u2019m very nervous every wet season in NQld. But it didn\u2019t flood in 2019 (just) or during this year\u2019s flood event in March.\u00a0I knew nothing about investing in property evidenced in the fact that I was negative equity until it finally grew enough 8 years later to negate the premium I paid the developer and builder. I built this house with my then gf and still own it 50/50 as tenants in common. I put in $23k cash, she $13k, and we were $405k all in. Current valuation 600k so a pretty poor effort over 8.5 years especially as the growth only came the last 18 months. It is a 7%+ gross yield on purchase now so it has been positively geared last two FYs at least. I plan to add a 4th bedroom by enclosing a 2nd living area to add an estimated 80-90k of equity based on comparables in the suburb and selling it in 2026. I will unlock the equity as cash, get the borrowing capacity back and dissolve the complex loan product I hold over the property with my ex. I need to check with my accountant but I think I can claim the 6 year rule on partial gains up to 2022 as I haven\u2019t claimed another PPOR. I didn\u2019t get it valued at the 6 year mark though so this might prove difficult if it\u2019s even possible!\n\nSecond property was also purchased in Townsville. May \u201824, 10% down at 450k with 5.4% gross yield, cash deposit. Bank valuation this June: 575k!! Third property in Mackay. Purchased September \u201824, 10% down at 570k with 5.02% gross yield cash and equity from property #1. Bank valuation this June: $650k!! So there\u2019s almost 400k of equity in the portfolio ATM. As a pharmacist I can get 90% LVR lend no LMI without being punished on the rates. It\u2019s a great lending product and very happy to be able to take advantage! I am pre-approved for 600k more in my personal name with this loan product. I plan to use this to buy in one of three locations: Lavington, Albury; South Grafton, NSW or Bendigo, VIC. Suburb medians are 500-570k and growing with demand and supply side data metrics looking promising while gross yields of 5%+ are achievable.\n\n# 3.7 Future Property Plans\n\nI\u2019m close to my Qld land tax threshold in my personal name and want to diversify states. WA and SA have had a lot of growth and Victoria has a few investors head winds: They have a low land tax threshold (50k!) and have hostile landlord policies. There\u2019s lots of developable land down that way so will have less of a supply constraint long term compared to other markets.\u00a0There\u2019s still potential for growth but I think there\u2019s better opportunities in NSW and Qld.\n\nGoing forward I will need to utilise trust structures to preserve my borrowing capacity. Broker says I\u2019ll be tapped out with the majors after #4 but I will still be able to lend with 2nd and 3rd tier lenders, especially if I let go of property #1. My 5th purchase is going to be a commercial property. I will then pigeon pair that inside the same trust with another growth property. This will help me pay off the debt of the commercial property in the future while keeping the trust positive through this holding period. The banks can disregard the debt inside that trust if it\u2019s positive cash flow and I can lend again based on my personal capacity. Strategy has been fleshed out with my broker and tax agent. It\u2019s risky obviously but damn I just love leverage.\n\nI don\u2019t have a goal for portfolio size, equity position or cashflow, but looking at growth on a $4.5m assets base in a [Future Value calculator](https://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html?cyearsv=30&cstartingprinciplev=4%2C500%2C000&cinterestratev=5&ccontributeamountv=0&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=Calculate#calresult) looks pretty good to me! Achievable too once I move into commercial property assets where I will be buying in higher price points.\n\n# 3.8 My ETF Investments\n\n**20.71% of NW**\n\n|Ticker|Allocation|Value|Contributions|%ROI|$ROI|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|VGS|61.24%|$89,570|$52,930|69.22%|$36,640|\n|VAS|21.96%|$32,121|$20,291|58.30%|$11,830|\n|GHFF|16.80%|$24,578|$21,879|12.34%|$2,699|\n|**Total**|**100.00%**|**$146,269**|**$95,100**|**53.81%**|**$51,170**|\n\nI\u2019m actually most obsessed with equities. Little bits of money that grow and pay you dividends. The worst thing that happens is they go down in price! Then you can buy more or use the income from the investments to buy more! So accessible, liquid, powerful. It has been third on my list of priorities as I gathered deposits and cashed in on Super deductions. Cashflow can get tight with my Super/Property strategy and I\u2019m not very liquid. So storing cash and extra savings in ETFs is my new drug! It really adds a lot of liquidity and accessible reserves to my portfolio. I burnt myself on some fun thematics like YOLO, ARKK and HCLN over the years. When I sold most of my assets to restructure my finances in 2022 I was down 24k on those. Sold out of my oil futures, single stocks as well (wish I\u2019d kept Palantir!). Went all in on an 80/20 VGS/VAS portfolio. Recently though I have been really excited about GHHF. It has a higher Oz content than I\u2019d like at 37% so I\u2019m continuing to buy VGS as well to keep me within my desired allocation. I haven\u2019t decided yet what ratio I want of leveraged ETFs but if I know myself, it will be as close to 100% as that mathematical asymptote will let me get lol. Leverage is just so sexy the way it juices returns! \u00a0\n\n# 3.9 My Crypto Investments\n\n**$104,036.11** | **14.73% of NW** | **BCH(69%)/BTC(18%)/ETH(13%)**\n\nI am a huge fan of transparent and immutable blockchain technology. It has a lot of applications. I\u2019m still waiting for the killer app, but it isn\u2019t BTC. I bought BTC in 2017 and also sold it in 2017 because it had gone up a lot and\u00a0transactions were congested and fees were so high it was unusable as peer to peer cash. I thought it would crash because it was useless; and still is with high fees and handicapped transaction volume. Big regrets tho lol.\n\nIf you know anything about crypto I didn\u2019t sell before the BCH hard fork at least. So I got all those coins for free! Which forked twice more for BSV and XEC. In 2022 during the great restructuring I sold the latter two hard forks for free money and also 12 shitcoins I had accumulated. I kept all my BCH and add to it regularly. For me it\u2019s the most useful crypto. You can send any amount instantly, peer to peer for less than a cent to anyone, anywhere in the world! The transaction is always confirmed in the next block for immutability. I love it. Couldn\u2019t resist DCAing back into BTC because damn that thing just keeps going up! I also invest in ETH. Crystallised $34k in gains from crypto over the years so Ive only got $24k of capital in my crypto portfolio.\n\nI think there\u2019s a place for crypto in anyone\u2019s portfolio but it has to be about a project you know and think has utility. My allocation is a little high at 14.73% relative to NW. Adding to my other assets will make my crypto allocation a smaller part of my NW over time. I don\u2019t expect the growth to be as explosive going forward so it should balance out soon. Aiming for 10% allocation of my NW.\n\n# 4.0\u00a0Future Plans and Goals\n\nHaving average expenses of <40kpa means I\u2019m not far from my FIRE number! However I expect my spend to increase significantly over the next decade. We will eventually start renting a \u201cdream home\u201d or purchase a PPOR, dial up the spend on travel/hobbies and charitable giving, and setup an awesome camping rig which will have significant ownership costs. I also love a bit of luxury so my FI number is likely much higher. I guess my minimum goal is around $1.5-1.9m which is 60-76kp on a 4% SWR. I still have another 2-3 years of building my property portfolio so will need to continue working full-time for servicing. Then I\u2019m feeling a CoastFI vibe while my assets compound for me. I will work a mandated 150 hours per year minimum to maintain my pharmacy registration and fluctuate my workload as I need. The question I\u2019m mulling over is what does that CoastFI job look like over the coming years?\n\nI could easily stay with this government job as it\u2019s been very relaxing and well paid with free accommodation. The rural site is not my gf\u2019s favourite place though so I probably can\u2019t stay for more than 18 months. Have been keeping an eye on other state health jobs for internal transfer. I could go back to locuming. I have a great network and there\u2019s still plenty of work on but my gf is definitely over it having traveled with me for 4 years! It\u2019s also a more difficult lending landscape for servicing. The other option is getting into a business partnership. Having met dozens of pharmacy owners over the years I have been offered 4 partnerships. Pharmacies usually return 10-15% on owners equity! You need to be a pharmacist to own a pharmacy so there\u2019s less competition to get in. It\u2019s also a protected industry from competitors and both sides of government are pro locally-owned community pharmacies compared to the corporate pharmacy business model you see in the US, for example. It\u2019s an enticing prospect. It would be a challenge and the pay off on the back end will be great into the future. I don\u2019t know if I have it in me though when I can get to where I\u2019m going on my current \u201ceasy\u201d path. Something to contemplate as I learn and grow as a person and an investor!\u00a0\n\n# 5.0 Resources\n\nIf you want a list of resources that I liked the most from my learning I share it regularly in subs.

          "selftext": "I once worked in a call centre position for a \"middle-man\" company that assisted in retaining monthly donors to some major charities (National Breast Cancer Foundation, McGrath Foundation, Seeing Eye Dogs, I forgot the rest but others were also major ones).\n\nAll we would do are 3 minute calls, after you signed up to support a foundation in a shopping centre, verifying your details and clarifying your commitment. At this point, we would be the \"empathetic salesman\" and adjust your donation amount incase you feel you over committed. But again, the goal is retainment.\n\nIn the fine print, that no one ever reads, it says that 97% of your donation for the first 2 years goes to our company and after those 2 years your money goes to the charity itself (I dont recall if that was 100% to the charity or not). Our company operated all across Australia and even started operating the front lines trying to get people signed up. The line they would have to say is, \"The X foundation really does benefit the most from donations of 2 years or more\" and then slap on a slogan at the end which is given to us by the foundation themself. We go by scripts for just about every question you have and the answers are all to entice you to stay donating your money.\n\nFinance wise, even the people who stand in a shopping mall asking you to do monthly donations may not even work directly for that foundation. You are allowed to ask if they get commission (they do), and how much of the money goes to the charity, but that doesn't mean people won't lie.\n\nMore of a moral finance thing than a tax purposes one here. I quite after a month. If you donate directly through their website, you skip all the outside dodgy-ness.",

I graduated a 4 year pharmacy degree in 2013 and interned for a year in 2014 at 22 years old. In 2017 I completed my MBA and also got a cash gift of $20k from my parents. Accrued $58k of HECS debt including $7,300 of indexation that took 10 years to pay off by 2024.\n\n# 1.1 Career Progression\n\nI worked in my home town for 3 years after graduation in a 9-5 before starting locum work in 2017 when my income took off. I was chasing the highest paid contracts in new locations I hadn\u2019t traveled to before. I would cover maternity/paternity contracts, owner/staff annual leave, busy holiday periods etc. This work coupled my thrill of making money with my desire to travel and see new places. I have worked in over 30 towns/cities in Australia and visited/camped in scores more in between contracts. Contracts could range from 2 weeks to 3 months.\n\nI love my job! I\u2019m a huge people person so being able to help people with their minor or major health care needs really makes me fulfilled! I have been very lucky to happen into a profession that I enjoy and has had really good wage growth.\u00a0\n\nIt was tough and stressful working as a contractor for 8 years under an ABN without annual/sick leave: sourcing contracts, negotiating contracts, syncing work calendars with social and personal commitments, living out of a cars and suitcases, driving thousands of kilometres to new jobs, difficult lending landscape, lumpy income, being away from friends and family etc. But the money was far better compared to working a regular pharmacy job. Being hourly I also maxed my workload while on contract so would routinely average 55 to 60 hours per week depending on the contract.\n\n# 1.2 Current Role\n\nIn 2025 my position is with a state government: $155k including 12.75% super. I received a $30k sign on bonus and will get a $20k retention bonus at 12 & 24 months. Accommodation is included as the location is a rural site. I work 38h Monday - Friday with an unpaid hour for lunch! The new work/life balance was great for 2 months. Then I started locuming on weekends because I\u2019m addicted to the hourly rate! Currently working 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on a Sunday for $110/h gross. So I\u2019m 52h/week across 7 days which is manageable but I (mostly my gf) would really like a day off. I\u2019m currently looking at dropping my two weekend shifts and negotiating a 14 hour shift on a Saturday at a new pharmacy for the $110/h rate! Same 52h but across 6 days. Perfect.\n\n# 2.0 Expenses and Savings Rate\n\n|Item|FY '22|FY '23|FY '24|FY '25|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Expenses**|**$38,906**|**$28,097**|**$35,143**|**$36,944**|\n|Debits|$7,391|$9,140|$3,556|$76|\n|Credit Card|$5,184|$9,207|$9,561|$19,631|\n|Joint A/c|$6,704|$9,750|$8,809|$6,481|\n|Int\u2019 Travel|$19,627|$0|$13,217|$10,756|\n||||||\n|**Post-tax SR**|**23.3%**|**77.8%**|**75.7%**|**76.3%**|\n\n# 2.1 Expenses in my 20s\n\nThrough uni (2010-2013) I worked casually at a pharmacy. Was paid quite a bit for an 18-21 year old pharmacy student so was pretty happy! Never really saved anything or invested at this stage. Lucky to live at home through my uni degree rent free. Spent all my cash buying 3 progressively more expensive second hand cars over 5 years which all needed hella repairs. Spent the rest of my money on house hold goods, food, booze, partying, drugs, domestic travel, dating, fashion, whatever. When I started working my pharmacy internship in 2014 I was paying $150/w in rent to my parents. This continued until I moved out in 2016 and had a mortgage with adult bills. Wasn\u2019t much left over after budgeting for bills and mortgage. You can see my income that year took a big dip! Was paid far more as a student than an intern!\n\n# 2.2 Adult Expenses\n\n2017 you can see my income increased a lot when I started locum work. So of course I dialled up the spend! I\u2019d converted my PPOR to an IP as I left my home town to start work on the road. So from 2017 until January 2025 I have never paid rent or a PPOR mortgage repayment. I negotiated contracts with employers to cover accommodation and usually travel costs. Sometimes it was caravan parks or motels, sometimes AirBnBs, the owner\u2019s homes or hotels. In between contracts we camp, stay with friends/family, overseas travel or book domestic accommodation. Currently I split $250/w with my gf for a room in a city I travel to for work on weekends. Having very little housing costs obviously has kept my living expenses extremely low. Not feasible forever but great to help me increase my savings rate and get a head start on investing.\n\nFortunate to have met my partner traveling in 2019 who was also on board with FI! This year she is now CoastFI on her overseas assets. We share all our living and travel expenses through a joint bank account we contribute to equally. I apportion the property portfolio equity, debt and cashflow 50/50 with her in our individual NW numbers. We have and will continue to use a mix of our cash for deposits and expenses. In the event of a breakup we will split the property assets 50/50 after paying out our individual contributions and cash in the offsets. All our other assets are separate.\n\n# 2.3 Savings Rate\n\nI keep spending pretty tight these days but I LOVE paying for convenience. I love not having to be stressed about the price of catching an Uber/Taxi, price of groceries, or buying/replacing something that I want when I need it. I don\u2019t bother tracking my spending too closely. I do have a budget that I update every year with my big known expenses and guestimates for fuel, food and discretionary spending etc but I don\u2019t reconcile it. The budgeted expenses come out pretty close to my top line spend in my Expenses/SR table so I don\u2019t feel the need to get more granular. The only thing I itemise further is international travel because that\u2019s a big part of my FI life! Savings rate has been >70% since I\u2019ve been living life thru the FI lens so I CBFd scrutinising my expenses any further.\n\n# 2.4 Lifestyle Creep\n\nI do love dropping a bomb on holidays though! 2018/19 spent $20.2k in SE Asia for 9 months meeting my gf at the end of it. 2022 I spent $19.6k on 4 months across 8 US states and Brazil. 2024 I spent $13.2k on 10 weeks in South America. 2025 I spent $10.7k on 4 weeks in the US.\u00a0\n\nAlready we've inflated our travel lifestyle by booking Airbnbs/hotels in our desired areas instead of hostels in a cheaper location. We book flights with convenient departure/arrival times even if they're more expensive. We have a spend-like-we\u2019re-rich rule on holiday to help us really enjoy ourselves. I'd love to be in a position to travel more often, upgrade to business class for flights >5 hours, dial up the luxury a lil in the accommodation we book, travel to more expensive locations, hire a private driver/tour guide, ball out on experiences in incredible locations etc. The lifestyle creep will come easy so I need to grow my NW to support the spend I want to have.\n\n# 3.0 Investing\n\n# Net Worth Summary\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Net Worth**|**$251,919**|**$390,401**|**$473,245**|**$708,486**|\n|$ increase||$138,482|$82,845|$229,240|\n|% increase||54.97%|21.22%|48.44%|\n\n# Assets\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Super|$58,227|$97,909|$134,719|$213,047|\n|Equities|$65,517|$59,176|$78,007|$146,269|\n|Property|$217,000|$206,000|$470,000|$762,500|\n|Crypto|$31,754|$56,260|$79,649|$104,036|\n|Cash|$29,607|$122,965|$88,600|$47,722|\n|Car|$9,125|$9,125|$8,000|$6,000|\n|**Total**|**$411,229**|**$551,435**|**$858,976**|**$1,273,574**|\n\n# Debt\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mortgage|$158,500|$154,995|$382,766|$567,200|\n|Credit Card|$810|$6,039|$2,964|$3,888|\n|**Total**|**$159,310**|**$161,034**|**$385,730**|**$571,088**|\n\nn.b.

From 2017 I had been \u2018investing\u2019 in assets with no real plan: penny stocks, single stocks, oil futures, crypto and some thematic ETFs. Clearly had employed zero education and strategy on how to invest in any asset class.\u00a0Had some winners and losers but ended up with a modest CGT bill. The gain pales in comparison to the returns I would have received by buying another IP or investing in my Super and ETFs since 2017 instead.\n\n# 3.2 Getting Educated\n\nIn 2022 I came back from another big, expensive, overseas holiday. I had spent all my cash and a my mix of random assets were in decline. I was again canvasing for some lucrative contracts to fill up the bank account. I knew I had to be more intentional with my money if I wanted to continue this lifestyle of travel and part-time work. I was getting into podcasts at this time and had been writing down a few book titles about investing, personal finance and self-help. So I dove into that!\n\nAfter my learning and finding r/FIAustralia and some other Subreddits I had discovered the 4% guideline and NW calculations. I was surprised to find that my NW was a touch over $250k, albeit spread across a bunch of random asset classes. Seeing that number at 29 years old was really motivating. I knew I could accelerate this journey by earning more. You can see from earnings FY23-FY25 my income increased a lot. I took less holidays but my hourly rate as a locum had also kept increasing. During downtime at work and after hours I spent an obscene amount of time devouring podcasts, books, articles, paid courses, webinars, websites, YT videos, Instagram reels, TikToks and Reddit learning as much as I could about investing, personal finance and property. I sold almost all my random mix of assets back to cash then I came up with my plan:\u00a0Super, property, ETFs, crypto. In that order.\n\n# 3.3 Super Philosophy\n\nI love Super. There is no better tax advantaged way to invest your money for building wealth. Yes Super is locked away until retirement age but that\u2019s the whole point of investing: allowing time to compound your capital by reinvesting the dividends while you add to the pile. By contributing to Super early you are allowing those extra tax dollars saved and contributed capital the longest time possible to compound, tax free!! If something catastrophic happens where I can no longer work and all my money is \u201clocked up\u201d in Super there are early access schemes, income protection, TPD insurance, government welfare programs, other assets, family and friends etc. There are myriad options to support you in the worst-case scenario instead of ignoring Super.\n\nYou really need to take care of yourself for when you\u2019re elderly and too broken to keep working. You do this by jacking your Super to the tits ASAP and then you can start bringing your retirement age back by investing outside of Super.\u00a0If you can\u2019t afford to top your Super up to the current $30k limit after your employer Super Guarantee (SG) you\u2019re probably not earning enough to retire that early anyway. Which means you should definitely prioritise Super. I love [this article](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/how-much-to-save-inside-vs-outside-super/#stages) from\u00a0[PassiveInvestingAustralia.com](http://PassiveInvestingAustralia.com)\u00a0showing how prioritising your Super as an investment will actually help you retire sooner as a low income earner. If you are a high earner you can afford to top up to $30k. You should definitely prioritise Super for the 15% (and 30% DIV293) tax rate which will be miles better than your marginal tax rates. \u00a0\n\n# 3.4 My Super Investment\n\n**$213,046.51** | **31.15% of NW**\n\nHaving the SG since I started working as a casual pharmacy student in 2011 meant I had a good head start on my balance. In 2020 I took out the COVID relief $20k. In hindsight I should have left it in there of course. Especially considering I left it in cash for over 6 months, missing the big V shaped recovery and new all time highs! Oops. In FY23 my income had increased a lot and I was looking for tax deductions. Checking MyGov, I had $90k of unused concessional contributions! I am spreading those tax deductions over 3-4 years to use them up consecutively before they expire after 5 years. I use concessional contributions and salary sacrificing to max my yearly cap and fill up previous unused caps.\n\nThrough my income and investment income in the future I always see myself maxing my contribution limit to Super. I may over invest in Super but I\u2019m not looking to retire ASAP and I plan to give a lot of my wealth away before I die. Investing in Super will give me a huge pot that could help a lot of people! I also plan on maintaining my pharmacy registration over the coming decades. I am required to work an annual 150 hours minimum. Perpetually CoastFI!\n\nI hate that DIV296 tax applies to unrealised gains. I don\u2019t mind taxing Super more above $3m on realised gains though. No one needs that much in Super. Based on my projections I will be close to that balance in 27 years at a traditional retirement age.\n\n# 3.5 Property Philosophy\n\nTalk about a tax deduction: if I love Super, then I\u2019m HORNY FOR PROPERTY! I actually don\u2019t love negative gearing though. Losing money to save your marginal tax rate is an absurd strategy but that's what we're stuck with in Australia. Can\u2019t wait to get my portfolio to neutral territory. I do love to claim the non-cash expenses like depreciation though! Leveraging to buy property is the best way to compound your capital IMO. You have way more control over your assets, can manufacture equity and directly increase the yields. You don\u2019t have that level of finesse over companies in the share market (unless you\u2019re getting a board seat lol). The massive low-cost leverage you can apply to your capital by investing in property makes it a superior investment option to build wealth compared to the light leverage you can get with equities. I think debt recycling is a really sexy strategy too and I can\u2019t wait to utilise that when we buy a home!\n\nThe reason property was second on my list of priorities over ETFs is two-fold, though related. Firstly, with leverage you can control a large dollar value of assets in the market. You want to benefit from the maximum amount of assets growing in the market for the most time possible. Secondly: government mandated inflation at 2-3% erodes the value of the debt. So you need to take on the debt and buy the assets ASAP to allow positive compounding on the largest amount of assets and negative compounding on your debt through inflation! This move was all about time. Maximising the time you control these huge assets with maximum leverage will compound better returns.\n\n# 3.6 My Property Investment\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|IPs|2.5|\n|Total Value|$1,525,000|\n|Total Debt|$1,134,400|\n|Net Value|$390,600|\n|Leverage Ratio|74%|\n|Offset Account|$47,722|\n|**Net Value**|**$438,322**|\n\n# Profit / Loss Statement\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Income|$74,620|\n|Total Expenses|$104,781|\n|Offset Gain Back|$2,983|\n|**Estimated Cashflow before tax**|**\u2013$27,178**|\n|Depreciation|$17,128|\n|Accountant Expense|$2,500|\n|Land Tax|$0|\n|Tax Rate %|39%|\n|**Estimated Cashflow after tax**|**\u2013$11,424**|\n\n# Blended Interest Rate                                                       6.25%\n\n**Equity share of $195 300 is 27.65% of NW.**\n\nIn 2016 I grossly overpaid on a house and land package in a Townsville suburb with lots of developable land AND in a flood zone! I\u2019m very nervous every wet season in NQld. But it didn\u2019t flood in 2019 (just) or during this year\u2019s flood event in March.\u00a0I knew nothing about investing in property evidenced in the fact that I was negative equity until it finally grew enough 8 years later to negate the premium I paid the developer and builder. I built this house with my then gf and still own it 50/50 as tenants in common. I put in $23k cash, she $13k, and we were $405k all in. Current valuation 600k so a pretty poor effort over 8.5 years especially as the growth only came the last 18 months. It is a 7%+ gross yield on purchase now so it has been positively geared last two FYs at least. I plan to add a 4th bedroom by enclosing a 2nd living area to add an estimated 80-90k of equity based on comparables in the suburb and selling it in 2026. I will unlock the equity as cash, get the borrowing capacity back and dissolve the complex loan product I hold over the property with my ex. I need to check with my accountant but I think I can claim the 6 year rule on partial gains up to 2022 as I haven\u2019t claimed another PPOR. I didn\u2019t get it valued at the 6 year mark though so this might prove difficult if it\u2019s even possible!\n\nSecond property was also purchased in Townsville. May \u201824, 10% down at 450k with 5.4% gross yield, cash deposit. Bank valuation this June: 575k!! Third property in Mackay. Purchased September \u201824, 10% down at 570k with 5.02% gross yield cash and equity from property #1. Bank valuation this June: $650k!! So there\u2019s almost 400k of equity in the portfolio ATM. As a pharmacist I can get 90% LVR lend no LMI without being punished on the rates. It\u2019s a great lending product and very happy to be able to take advantage! I am pre-approved for 600k more in my personal name with this loan product. I plan to use this to buy in one of three locations: Lavington, Albury; South Grafton, NSW or Bendigo, VIC. Suburb medians are 500-570k and growing with demand and supply side data metrics looking promising while gross yields of 5%+ are achievable.\n\n# 3.7 Future Property Plans\n\nI\u2019m close to my Qld land tax threshold in my personal name and want to diversify states. WA and SA have had a lot of growth and Victoria has a few investors head winds: They have a low land tax threshold (50k!) and have hostile landlord policies. There\u2019s lots of developable land down that way so will have less of a supply constraint long term compared to other markets.\u00a0There\u2019s still potential for growth but I think there\u2019s better opportunities in NSW and Qld.\n\nGoing forward I will need to utilise trust structures to preserve my borrowing capacity. Broker says I\u2019ll be tapped out with the majors after #4 but I will still be able to lend with 2nd and 3rd tier lenders, especially if I let go of property #1. My 5th purchase is going to be a commercial property. I will then pigeon pair that inside the same trust with another growth property. This will help me pay off the debt of the commercial property in the future while keeping the trust positive through this holding period. The banks can disregard the debt inside that trust if it\u2019s positive cash flow and I can lend again based on my personal capacity. Strategy has been fleshed out with my broker and tax agent. It\u2019s risky obviously but damn I just love leverage.\n\nI don\u2019t have a goal for portfolio size, equity position or cashflow, but looking at growth on a $4.5m assets base in a [Future Value calculator](https://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html?cyearsv=30&cstartingprinciplev=4%2C500%2C000&cinterestratev=5&ccontributeamountv=0&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=Calculate#calresult) looks pretty good to me! Achievable too once I move into commercial property assets where I will be buying in higher price points.\n\n# 3.8 My ETF Investments\n\n**20.71% of NW**\n\n|Ticker|Allocation|Value|Contributions|%ROI|$ROI|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|VGS|61.24%|$89,570|$52,930|69.22%|$36,640|\n|VAS|21.96%|$32,121|$20,291|58.30%|$11,830|\n|GHFF|16.80%|$24,578|$21,879|12.34%|$2,699|\n|**Total**|**100.00%**|**$146,269**|**$95,100**|**53.81%**|**$51,170**|\n\nI\u2019m actually most obsessed with equities. Little bits of money that grow and pay you dividends. The worst thing that happens is they go down in price! Then you can buy more or use the income from the investments to buy more! So accessible, liquid, powerful. It has been third on my list of priorities as I gathered deposits and cashed in on Super deductions. Cashflow can get tight with my Super/Property strategy and I\u2019m not very liquid. So storing cash and extra savings in ETFs is my new drug! It really adds a lot of liquidity and accessible reserves to my portfolio. I burnt myself on some fun thematics like YOLO, ARKK and HCLN over the years. When I sold most of my assets to restructure my finances in 2022 I was down 24k on those. Sold out of my oil futures, single stocks as well (wish I\u2019d kept Palantir!). Went all in on an 80/20 VGS/VAS portfolio. Recently though I have been really excited about GHHF. It has a higher Oz content than I\u2019d like at 37% so I\u2019m continuing to buy VGS as well to keep me within my desired allocation. I haven\u2019t decided yet what ratio I want of leveraged ETFs but if I know myself, it will be as close to 100% as that mathematical asymptote will let me get lol. Leverage is just so sexy the way it juices returns! \u00a0\n\n# 3.9 My Crypto Investments\n\n**$104,036.11** | **14.73% of NW** | **BCH(69%)/BTC(18%)/ETH(13%)**\n\nI am a huge fan of transparent and immutable blockchain technology. It has a lot of applications. I\u2019m still waiting for the killer app, but it isn\u2019t BTC. I bought BTC in 2017 and also sold it in 2017 because it had gone up a lot and\u00a0transactions were congested and fees were so high it was unusable as peer to peer cash. I thought it would crash because it was useless; and still is with high fees and handicapped transaction volume. Big regrets tho lol.\n\nIf you know anything about crypto I didn\u2019t sell before the BCH hard fork at least. So I got all those coins for free! Which forked twice more for BSV and XEC. In 2022 during the great restructuring I sold the latter two hard forks for free money and also 12 shitcoins I had accumulated. I kept all my BCH and add to it regularly. For me it\u2019s the most useful crypto. You can send any amount instantly, peer to peer for less than a cent to anyone, anywhere in the world! The transaction is always confirmed in the next block for immutability. I love it. Couldn\u2019t resist DCAing back into BTC because damn that thing just keeps going up! I also invest in ETH. Crystallised $34k in gains from crypto over the years so Ive only got $24k of capital in my crypto portfolio.\n\nI think there\u2019s a place for crypto in anyone\u2019s portfolio but it has to be about a project you know and think has utility. My allocation is a little high at 14.73% relative to NW. Adding to my other assets will make my crypto allocation a smaller part of my NW over time. I don\u2019t expect the growth to be as explosive going forward so it should balance out soon. Aiming for 10% allocation of my NW.\n\n# 4.0\u00a0Future Plans and Goals\n\nHaving average expenses of <40kpa means I\u2019m not far from my FIRE number! However I expect my spend to increase significantly over the next decade. We will eventually start renting a \u201cdream home\u201d or purchase a PPOR, dial up the spend on travel/hobbies and charitable giving, and setup an awesome camping rig which will have significant ownership costs. I also love a bit of luxury so my FI number is likely much higher. I guess my minimum goal is around $1.5-1.9m which is 60-76kp on a 4% SWR. I still have another 2-3 years of building my property portfolio so will need to continue working full-time for servicing. Then I\u2019m feeling a CoastFI vibe while my assets compound for me. I will work a mandated 150 hours per year minimum to maintain my pharmacy registration and fluctuate my workload as I need. The question I\u2019m mulling over is what does that CoastFI job look like over the coming years?\n\nI could easily stay with this government job as it\u2019s been very relaxing and well paid with free accommodation. The rural site is not my gf\u2019s favourite place though so I probably can\u2019t stay for more than 18 months. Have been keeping an eye on other state health jobs for internal transfer. I could go back to locuming. I have a great network and there\u2019s still plenty of work on but my gf is definitely over it having traveled with me for 4 years! It\u2019s also a more difficult lending landscape for servicing. The other option is getting into a business partnership. Having met dozens of pharmacy owners over the years I have been offered 4 partnerships. Pharmacies usually return 10-15% on owners equity! You need to be a pharmacist to own a pharmacy so there\u2019s less competition to get in. It\u2019s also a protected industry from competitors and both sides of government are pro locally-owned community pharmacies compared to the corporate pharmacy business model you see in the US, for example. It\u2019s an enticing prospect. It would be a challenge and the pay off on the back end will be great into the future. I don\u2019t know if I have it in me though when I can get to where I\u2019m going on my current \u201ceasy\u201d path. Something to contemplate as I learn and grow as a person and an investor!\u00a0\n\n# 5.0 Resources\n\nIf you want a list of resources that I liked the most from my learning I share it regularly in subs.

          "selftext": "I once worked in a call centre position for a \"middle-man\" company that assisted in retaining monthly donors to some major charities (National Breast Cancer Foundation, McGrath Foundation, Seeing Eye Dogs, I forgot the rest but others were also major ones).\n\nAll we would do are 3 minute calls, after you signed up to support a foundation in a shopping centre, verifying your details and clarifying your commitment. At this point, we would be the \"empathetic salesman\" and adjust your donation amount incase you feel you over committed. But again, the goal is retainment.\n\nIn the fine print, that no one ever reads, it says that 97% of your donation for the first 2 years goes to our company and after those 2 years your money goes to the charity itself (I dont recall if that was 100% to the charity or not). Our company operated all across Australia and even started operating the front lines trying to get people signed up. The line they would have to say is, \"The X foundation really does benefit the most from donations of 2 years or more\" and then slap on a slogan at the end which is given to us by the foundation themself. We go by scripts for just about every question you have and the answers are all to entice you to stay donating your money.\n\nFinance wise, even the people who stand in a shopping mall asking you to do monthly donations may not even work directly for that foundation. You are allowed to ask if they get commission (they do), and how much of the money goes to the charity, but that doesn't mean people won't lie.\n\nMore of a moral finance thing than a tax purposes one here. I quite after a month. If you donate directly through their website, you skip all the outside dodgy-ness.",

I graduated a 4 year pharmacy degree in 2013 and interned for a year in 2014 at 22 years old. In 2017 I completed my MBA and also got a cash gift of $20k from my parents. Accrued $58k of HECS debt including $7,300 of indexation that took 10 years to pay off by 2024.\n\n# 1.1 Career Progression\n\nI worked in my home town for 3 years after graduation in a 9-5 before starting locum work in 2017 when my income took off. I was chasing the highest paid contracts in new locations I hadn\u2019t traveled to before. I would cover maternity/paternity contracts, owner/staff annual leave, busy holiday periods etc. This work coupled my thrill of making money with my desire to travel and see new places. I have worked in over 30 towns/cities in Australia and visited/camped in scores more in between contracts. Contracts could range from 2 weeks to 3 months.\n\nI love my job! I\u2019m a huge people person so being able to help people with their minor or major health care needs really makes me fulfilled! I have been very lucky to happen into a profession that I enjoy and has had really good wage growth.\u00a0\n\nIt was tough and stressful working as a contractor for 8 years under an ABN without annual/sick leave: sourcing contracts, negotiating contracts, syncing work calendars with social and personal commitments, living out of a cars and suitcases, driving thousands of kilometres to new jobs, difficult lending landscape, lumpy income, being away from friends and family etc. But the money was far better compared to working a regular pharmacy job. Being hourly I also maxed my workload while on contract so would routinely average 55 to 60 hours per week depending on the contract.\n\n# 1.2 Current Role\n\nIn 2025 my position is with a state government: $155k including 12.75% super. I received a $30k sign on bonus and will get a $20k retention bonus at 12 & 24 months. Accommodation is included as the location is a rural site. I work 38h Monday - Friday with an unpaid hour for lunch! The new work/life balance was great for 2 months. Then I started locuming on weekends because I\u2019m addicted to the hourly rate! Currently working 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on a Sunday for $110/h gross. So I\u2019m 52h/week across 7 days which is manageable but I (mostly my gf) would really like a day off. I\u2019m currently looking at dropping my two weekend shifts and negotiating a 14 hour shift on a Saturday at a new pharmacy for the $110/h rate! Same 52h but across 6 days. Perfect.\n\n# 2.0 Expenses and Savings Rate\n\n|Item|FY '22|FY '23|FY '24|FY '25|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Expenses**|**$38,906**|**$28,097**|**$35,143**|**$36,944**|\n|Debits|$7,391|$9,140|$3,556|$76|\n|Credit Card|$5,184|$9,207|$9,561|$19,631|\n|Joint A/c|$6,704|$9,750|$8,809|$6,481|\n|Int\u2019 Travel|$19,627|$0|$13,217|$10,756|\n||||||\n|**Post-tax SR**|**23.3%**|**77.8%**|**75.7%**|**76.3%**|\n\n# 2.1 Expenses in my 20s\n\nThrough uni (2010-2013) I worked casually at a pharmacy. Was paid quite a bit for an 18-21 year old pharmacy student so was pretty happy! Never really saved anything or invested at this stage. Lucky to live at home through my uni degree rent free. Spent all my cash buying 3 progressively more expensive second hand cars over 5 years which all needed hella repairs. Spent the rest of my money on house hold goods, food, booze, partying, drugs, domestic travel, dating, fashion, whatever. When I started working my pharmacy internship in 2014 I was paying $150/w in rent to my parents. This continued until I moved out in 2016 and had a mortgage with adult bills. Wasn\u2019t much left over after budgeting for bills and mortgage. You can see my income that year took a big dip! Was paid far more as a student than an intern!\n\n# 2.2 Adult Expenses\n\n2017 you can see my income increased a lot when I started locum work. So of course I dialled up the spend! I\u2019d converted my PPOR to an IP as I left my home town to start work on the road. So from 2017 until January 2025 I have never paid rent or a PPOR mortgage repayment. I negotiated contracts with employers to cover accommodation and usually travel costs. Sometimes it was caravan parks or motels, sometimes AirBnBs, the owner\u2019s homes or hotels. In between contracts we camp, stay with friends/family, overseas travel or book domestic accommodation. Currently I split $250/w with my gf for a room in a city I travel to for work on weekends. Having very little housing costs obviously has kept my living expenses extremely low. Not feasible forever but great to help me increase my savings rate and get a head start on investing.\n\nFortunate to have met my partner traveling in 2019 who was also on board with FI! This year she is now CoastFI on her overseas assets. We share all our living and travel expenses through a joint bank account we contribute to equally. I apportion the property portfolio equity, debt and cashflow 50/50 with her in our individual NW numbers. We have and will continue to use a mix of our cash for deposits and expenses. In the event of a breakup we will split the property assets 50/50 after paying out our individual contributions and cash in the offsets. All our other assets are separate.\n\n# 2.3 Savings Rate\n\nI keep spending pretty tight these days but I LOVE paying for convenience. I love not having to be stressed about the price of catching an Uber/Taxi, price of groceries, or buying/replacing something that I want when I need it. I don\u2019t bother tracking my spending too closely. I do have a budget that I update every year with my big known expenses and guestimates for fuel, food and discretionary spending etc but I don\u2019t reconcile it. The budgeted expenses come out pretty close to my top line spend in my Expenses/SR table so I don\u2019t feel the need to get more granular. The only thing I itemise further is international travel because that\u2019s a big part of my FI life! Savings rate has been >70% since I\u2019ve been living life thru the FI lens so I CBFd scrutinising my expenses any further.\n\n# 2.4 Lifestyle Creep\n\nI do love dropping a bomb on holidays though! 2018/19 spent $20.2k in SE Asia for 9 months meeting my gf at the end of it. 2022 I spent $19.6k on 4 months across 8 US states and Brazil. 2024 I spent $13.2k on 10 weeks in South America. 2025 I spent $10.7k on 4 weeks in the US.\u00a0\n\nAlready we've inflated our travel lifestyle by booking Airbnbs/hotels in our desired areas instead of hostels in a cheaper location. We book flights with convenient departure/arrival times even if they're more expensive. We have a spend-like-we\u2019re-rich rule on holiday to help us really enjoy ourselves. I'd love to be in a position to travel more often, upgrade to business class for flights >5 hours, dial up the luxury a lil in the accommodation we book, travel to more expensive locations, hire a private driver/tour guide, ball out on experiences in incredible locations etc. The lifestyle creep will come easy so I need to grow my NW to support the spend I want to have.\n\n# 3.0 Investing\n\n# Net Worth Summary\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Net Worth**|**$251,919**|**$390,401**|**$473,245**|**$708,486**|\n|$ increase||$138,482|$82,845|$229,240|\n|% increase||54.97%|21.22%|48.44%|\n\n# Assets\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Super|$58,227|$97,909|$134,719|$213,047|\n|Equities|$65,517|$59,176|$78,007|$146,269|\n|Property|$217,000|$206,000|$470,000|$762,500|\n|Crypto|$31,754|$56,260|$79,649|$104,036|\n|Cash|$29,607|$122,965|$88,600|$47,722|\n|Car|$9,125|$9,125|$8,000|$6,000|\n|**Total**|**$411,229**|**$551,435**|**$858,976**|**$1,273,574**|\n\n# Debt\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mortgage|$158,500|$154,995|$382,766|$567,200|\n|Credit Card|$810|$6,039|$2,964|$3,888|\n|**Total**|**$159,310**|**$161,034**|**$385,730**|**$571,088**|\n\nn.b.

From 2017 I had been \u2018investing\u2019 in assets with no real plan: penny stocks, single stocks, oil futures, crypto and some thematic ETFs. Clearly had employed zero education and strategy on how to invest in any asset class.\u00a0Had some winners and losers but ended up with a modest CGT bill. The gain pales in comparison to the returns I would have received by buying another IP or investing in my Super and ETFs since 2017 instead.\n\n# 3.2 Getting Educated\n\nIn 2022 I came back from another big, expensive, overseas holiday. I had spent all my cash and a my mix of random assets were in decline. I was again canvasing for some lucrative contracts to fill up the bank account. I knew I had to be more intentional with my money if I wanted to continue this lifestyle of travel and part-time work. I was getting into podcasts at this time and had been writing down a few book titles about investing, personal finance and self-help. So I dove into that!\n\nAfter my learning and finding r/FIAustralia and some other Subreddits I had discovered the 4% guideline and NW calculations. I was surprised to find that my NW was a touch over $250k, albeit spread across a bunch of random asset classes. Seeing that number at 29 years old was really motivating. I knew I could accelerate this journey by earning more. You can see from earnings FY23-FY25 my income increased a lot. I took less holidays but my hourly rate as a locum had also kept increasing. During downtime at work and after hours I spent an obscene amount of time devouring podcasts, books, articles, paid courses, webinars, websites, YT videos, Instagram reels, TikToks and Reddit learning as much as I could about investing, personal finance and property. I sold almost all my random mix of assets back to cash then I came up with my plan:\u00a0Super, property, ETFs, crypto. In that order.\n\n# 3.3 Super Philosophy\n\nI love Super. There is no better tax advantaged way to invest your money for building wealth. Yes Super is locked away until retirement age but that\u2019s the whole point of investing: allowing time to compound your capital by reinvesting the dividends while you add to the pile. By contributing to Super early you are allowing those extra tax dollars saved and contributed capital the longest time possible to compound, tax free!! If something catastrophic happens where I can no longer work and all my money is \u201clocked up\u201d in Super there are early access schemes, income protection, TPD insurance, government welfare programs, other assets, family and friends etc. There are myriad options to support you in the worst-case scenario instead of ignoring Super.\n\nYou really need to take care of yourself for when you\u2019re elderly and too broken to keep working. You do this by jacking your Super to the tits ASAP and then you can start bringing your retirement age back by investing outside of Super.\u00a0If you can\u2019t afford to top your Super up to the current $30k limit after your employer Super Guarantee (SG) you\u2019re probably not earning enough to retire that early anyway. Which means you should definitely prioritise Super. I love [this article](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/how-much-to-save-inside-vs-outside-super/#stages) from\u00a0[PassiveInvestingAustralia.com](http://PassiveInvestingAustralia.com)\u00a0showing how prioritising your Super as an investment will actually help you retire sooner as a low income earner. If you are a high earner you can afford to top up to $30k. You should definitely prioritise Super for the 15% (and 30% DIV293) tax rate which will be miles better than your marginal tax rates. \u00a0\n\n# 3.4 My Super Investment\n\n**$213,046.51** | **31.15% of NW**\n\nHaving the SG since I started working as a casual pharmacy student in 2011 meant I had a good head start on my balance. In 2020 I took out the COVID relief $20k. In hindsight I should have left it in there of course. Especially considering I left it in cash for over 6 months, missing the big V shaped recovery and new all time highs! Oops. In FY23 my income had increased a lot and I was looking for tax deductions. Checking MyGov, I had $90k of unused concessional contributions! I am spreading those tax deductions over 3-4 years to use them up consecutively before they expire after 5 years. I use concessional contributions and salary sacrificing to max my yearly cap and fill up previous unused caps.\n\nThrough my income and investment income in the future I always see myself maxing my contribution limit to Super. I may over invest in Super but I\u2019m not looking to retire ASAP and I plan to give a lot of my wealth away before I die. Investing in Super will give me a huge pot that could help a lot of people! I also plan on maintaining my pharmacy registration over the coming decades. I am required to work an annual 150 hours minimum. Perpetually CoastFI!\n\nI hate that DIV296 tax applies to unrealised gains. I don\u2019t mind taxing Super more above $3m on realised gains though. No one needs that much in Super. Based on my projections I will be close to that balance in 27 years at a traditional retirement age.\n\n# 3.5 Property Philosophy\n\nTalk about a tax deduction: if I love Super, then I\u2019m HORNY FOR PROPERTY! I actually don\u2019t love negative gearing though. Losing money to save your marginal tax rate is an absurd strategy but that's what we're stuck with in Australia. Can\u2019t wait to get my portfolio to neutral territory. I do love to claim the non-cash expenses like depreciation though! Leveraging to buy property is the best way to compound your capital IMO. You have way more control over your assets, can manufacture equity and directly increase the yields. You don\u2019t have that level of finesse over companies in the share market (unless you\u2019re getting a board seat lol). The massive low-cost leverage you can apply to your capital by investing in property makes it a superior investment option to build wealth compared to the light leverage you can get with equities. I think debt recycling is a really sexy strategy too and I can\u2019t wait to utilise that when we buy a home!\n\nThe reason property was second on my list of priorities over ETFs is two-fold, though related. Firstly, with leverage you can control a large dollar value of assets in the market. You want to benefit from the maximum amount of assets growing in the market for the most time possible. Secondly: government mandated inflation at 2-3% erodes the value of the debt. So you need to take on the debt and buy the assets ASAP to allow positive compounding on the largest amount of assets and negative compounding on your debt through inflation! This move was all about time. Maximising the time you control these huge assets with maximum leverage will compound better returns.\n\n# 3.6 My Property Investment\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|IPs|2.5|\n|Total Value|$1,525,000|\n|Total Debt|$1,134,400|\n|Net Value|$390,600|\n|Leverage Ratio|74%|\n|Offset Account|$47,722|\n|**Net Value**|**$438,322**|\n\n# Profit / Loss Statement\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Income|$74,620|\n|Total Expenses|$104,781|\n|Offset Gain Back|$2,983|\n|**Estimated Cashflow before tax**|**\u2013$27,178**|\n|Depreciation|$17,128|\n|Accountant Expense|$2,500|\n|Land Tax|$0|\n|Tax Rate %|39%|\n|**Estimated Cashflow after tax**|**\u2013$11,424**|\n\n# Blended Interest Rate                                                       6.25%\n\n**Equity share of $195 300 is 27.65% of NW.**\n\nIn 2016 I grossly overpaid on a house and land package in a Townsville suburb with lots of developable land AND in a flood zone! I\u2019m very nervous every wet season in NQld. But it didn\u2019t flood in 2019 (just) or during this year\u2019s flood event in March.\u00a0I knew nothing about investing in property evidenced in the fact that I was negative equity until it finally grew enough 8 years later to negate the premium I paid the developer and builder. I built this house with my then gf and still own it 50/50 as tenants in common. I put in $23k cash, she $13k, and we were $405k all in. Current valuation 600k so a pretty poor effort over 8.5 years especially as the growth only came the last 18 months. It is a 7%+ gross yield on purchase now so it has been positively geared last two FYs at least. I plan to add a 4th bedroom by enclosing a 2nd living area to add an estimated 80-90k of equity based on comparables in the suburb and selling it in 2026. I will unlock the equity as cash, get the borrowing capacity back and dissolve the complex loan product I hold over the property with my ex. I need to check with my accountant but I think I can claim the 6 year rule on partial gains up to 2022 as I haven\u2019t claimed another PPOR. I didn\u2019t get it valued at the 6 year mark though so this might prove difficult if it\u2019s even possible!\n\nSecond property was also purchased in Townsville. May \u201824, 10% down at 450k with 5.4% gross yield, cash deposit. Bank valuation this June: 575k!! Third property in Mackay. Purchased September \u201824, 10% down at 570k with 5.02% gross yield cash and equity from property #1. Bank valuation this June: $650k!! So there\u2019s almost 400k of equity in the portfolio ATM. As a pharmacist I can get 90% LVR lend no LMI without being punished on the rates. It\u2019s a great lending product and very happy to be able to take advantage! I am pre-approved for 600k more in my personal name with this loan product. I plan to use this to buy in one of three locations: Lavington, Albury; South Grafton, NSW or Bendigo, VIC. Suburb medians are 500-570k and growing with demand and supply side data metrics looking promising while gross yields of 5%+ are achievable.\n\n# 3.7 Future Property Plans\n\nI\u2019m close to my Qld land tax threshold in my personal name and want to diversify states. WA and SA have had a lot of growth and Victoria has a few investors head winds: They have a low land tax threshold (50k!) and have hostile landlord policies. There\u2019s lots of developable land down that way so will have less of a supply constraint long term compared to other markets.\u00a0There\u2019s still potential for growth but I think there\u2019s better opportunities in NSW and Qld.\n\nGoing forward I will need to utilise trust structures to preserve my borrowing capacity. Broker says I\u2019ll be tapped out with the majors after #4 but I will still be able to lend with 2nd and 3rd tier lenders, especially if I let go of property #1. My 5th purchase is going to be a commercial property. I will then pigeon pair that inside the same trust with another growth property. This will help me pay off the debt of the commercial property in the future while keeping the trust positive through this holding period. The banks can disregard the debt inside that trust if it\u2019s positive cash flow and I can lend again based on my personal capacity. Strategy has been fleshed out with my broker and tax agent. It\u2019s risky obviously but damn I just love leverage.\n\nI don\u2019t have a goal for portfolio size, equity position or cashflow, but looking at growth on a $4.5m assets base in a [Future Value calculator](https://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html?cyearsv=30&cstartingprinciplev=4%2C500%2C000&cinterestratev=5&ccontributeamountv=0&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=Calculate#calresult) looks pretty good to me! Achievable too once I move into commercial property assets where I will be buying in higher price points.\n\n# 3.8 My ETF Investments\n\n**20.71% of NW**\n\n|Ticker|Allocation|Value|Contributions|%ROI|$ROI|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|VGS|61.24%|$89,570|$52,930|69.22%|$36,640|\n|VAS|21.96%|$32,121|$20,291|58.30%|$11,830|\n|GHFF|16.80%|$24,578|$21,879|12.34%|$2,699|\n|**Total**|**100.00%**|**$146,269**|**$95,100**|**53.81%**|**$51,170**|\n\nI\u2019m actually most obsessed with equities. Little bits of money that grow and pay you dividends. The worst thing that happens is they go down in price! Then you can buy more or use the income from the investments to buy more! So accessible, liquid, powerful. It has been third on my list of priorities as I gathered deposits and cashed in on Super deductions. Cashflow can get tight with my Super/Property strategy and I\u2019m not very liquid. So storing cash and extra savings in ETFs is my new drug! It really adds a lot of liquidity and accessible reserves to my portfolio. I burnt myself on some fun thematics like YOLO, ARKK and HCLN over the years. When I sold most of my assets to restructure my finances in 2022 I was down 24k on those. Sold out of my oil futures, single stocks as well (wish I\u2019d kept Palantir!). Went all in on an 80/20 VGS/VAS portfolio. Recently though I have been really excited about GHHF. It has a higher Oz content than I\u2019d like at 37% so I\u2019m continuing to buy VGS as well to keep me within my desired allocation. I haven\u2019t decided yet what ratio I want of leveraged ETFs but if I know myself, it will be as close to 100% as that mathematical asymptote will let me get lol. Leverage is just so sexy the way it juices returns! \u00a0\n\n# 3.9 My Crypto Investments\n\n**$104,036.11** | **14.73% of NW** | **BCH(69%)/BTC(18%)/ETH(13%)**\n\nI am a huge fan of transparent and immutable blockchain technology. It has a lot of applications. I\u2019m still waiting for the killer app, but it isn\u2019t BTC. I bought BTC in 2017 and also sold it in 2017 because it had gone up a lot and\u00a0transactions were congested and fees were so high it was unusable as peer to peer cash. I thought it would crash because it was useless; and still is with high fees and handicapped transaction volume. Big regrets tho lol.\n\nIf you know anything about crypto I didn\u2019t sell before the BCH hard fork at least. So I got all those coins for free! Which forked twice more for BSV and XEC. In 2022 during the great restructuring I sold the latter two hard forks for free money and also 12 shitcoins I had accumulated. I kept all my BCH and add to it regularly. For me it\u2019s the most useful crypto. You can send any amount instantly, peer to peer for less than a cent to anyone, anywhere in the world! The transaction is always confirmed in the next block for immutability. I love it. Couldn\u2019t resist DCAing back into BTC because damn that thing just keeps going up! I also invest in ETH. Crystallised $34k in gains from crypto over the years so Ive only got $24k of capital in my crypto portfolio.\n\nI think there\u2019s a place for crypto in anyone\u2019s portfolio but it has to be about a project you know and think has utility. My allocation is a little high at 14.73% relative to NW. Adding to my other assets will make my crypto allocation a smaller part of my NW over time. I don\u2019t expect the growth to be as explosive going forward so it should balance out soon. Aiming for 10% allocation of my NW.\n\n# 4.0\u00a0Future Plans and Goals\n\nHaving average expenses of <40kpa means I\u2019m not far from my FIRE number! However I expect my spend to increase significantly over the next decade. We will eventually start renting a \u201cdream home\u201d or purchase a PPOR, dial up the spend on travel/hobbies and charitable giving, and setup an awesome camping rig which will have significant ownership costs. I also love a bit of luxury so my FI number is likely much higher. I guess my minimum goal is around $1.5-1.9m which is 60-76kp on a 4% SWR. I still have another 2-3 years of building my property portfolio so will need to continue working full-time for servicing. Then I\u2019m feeling a CoastFI vibe while my assets compound for me. I will work a mandated 150 hours per year minimum to maintain my pharmacy registration and fluctuate my workload as I need. The question I\u2019m mulling over is what does that CoastFI job look like over the coming years?\n\nI could easily stay with this government job as it\u2019s been very relaxing and well paid with free accommodation. The rural site is not my gf\u2019s favourite place though so I probably can\u2019t stay for more than 18 months. Have been keeping an eye on other state health jobs for internal transfer. I could go back to locuming. I have a great network and there\u2019s still plenty of work on but my gf is definitely over it having traveled with me for 4 years! It\u2019s also a more difficult lending landscape for servicing. The other option is getting into a business partnership. Having met dozens of pharmacy owners over the years I have been offered 4 partnerships. Pharmacies usually return 10-15% on owners equity! You need to be a pharmacist to own a pharmacy so there\u2019s less competition to get in. It\u2019s also a protected industry from competitors and both sides of government are pro locally-owned community pharmacies compared to the corporate pharmacy business model you see in the US, for example. It\u2019s an enticing prospect. It would be a challenge and the pay off on the back end will be great into the future. I don\u2019t know if I have it in me though when I can get to where I\u2019m going on my current \u201ceasy\u201d path. Something to contemplate as I learn and grow as a person and an investor!\u00a0\n\n# 5.0 Resources\n\nIf you want a list of resources that I liked the most from my learning I share it regularly in subs.

          "selftext": "I once worked in a call centre position for a \"middle-man\" company that assisted in retaining monthly donors to some major charities (National Breast Cancer Foundation, McGrath Foundation, Seeing Eye Dogs, I forgot the rest but others were also major ones).\n\nAll we would do are 3 minute calls, after you signed up to support a foundation in a shopping centre, verifying your details and clarifying your commitment. At this point, we would be the \"empathetic salesman\" and adjust your donation amount incase you feel you over committed. But again, the goal is retainment.\n\nIn the fine print, that no one ever reads, it says that 97% of your donation for the first 2 years goes to our company and after those 2 years your money goes to the charity itself (I dont recall if that was 100% to the charity or not). Our company operated all across Australia and even started operating the front lines trying to get people signed up. The line they would have to say is, \"The X foundation really does benefit the most from donations of 2 years or more\" and then slap on a slogan at the end which is given to us by the foundation themself. We go by scripts for just about every question you have and the answers are all to entice you to stay donating your money.\n\nFinance wise, even the people who stand in a shopping mall asking you to do monthly donations may not even work directly for that foundation. You are allowed to ask if they get commission (they do), and how much of the money goes to the charity, but that doesn't mean people won't lie.\n\nMore of a moral finance thing than a tax purposes one here. I quite after a month. If you donate directly through their website, you skip all the outside dodgy-ness.",

I checked the BSB of the account it went to, and it's another NAB account located on the south coast of NSW (I'm in Newcastle).\n\nThe bank operator said the chances of the money being returned are very slim.\n\nIt's all very strange. I have SMS 2-factor set up and didn't receive any sms during the night asking for a code for a new login, etc. I assume ive had a password leak during a hack.\n\nThe bank said it's from an IP similar to mine but located in Sydney. I would never log into my bank on an unknown computer, and 95% access my bank using my phone. \n\nI thought they could have gotten access through my Google account, but ive checked the activity logs and there has been nothing through my Google account from when I went to bed until I woke up. \n\nA bit concerned.

I graduated a 4 year pharmacy degree in 2013 and interned for a year in 2014 at 22 years old. In 2017 I completed my MBA and also got a cash gift of $20k from my parents. Accrued $58k of HECS debt including $7,300 of indexation that took 10 years to pay off by 2024.\n\n# 1.1 Career Progression\n\nI worked in my home town for 3 years after graduation in a 9-5 before starting locum work in 2017 when my income took off. I was chasing the highest paid contracts in new locations I hadn\u2019t traveled to before. I would cover maternity/paternity contracts, owner/staff annual leave, busy holiday periods etc. This work coupled my thrill of making money with my desire to travel and see new places. I have worked in over 30 towns/cities in Australia and visited/camped in scores more in between contracts. Contracts could range from 2 weeks to 3 months.\n\nI love my job! I\u2019m a huge people person so being able to help people with their minor or major health care needs really makes me fulfilled! I have been very lucky to happen into a profession that I enjoy and has had really good wage growth.\u00a0\n\nIt was tough and stressful working as a contractor for 8 years under an ABN without annual/sick leave: sourcing contracts, negotiating contracts, syncing work calendars with social and personal commitments, living out of a cars and suitcases, driving thousands of kilometres to new jobs, difficult lending landscape, lumpy income, being away from friends and family etc. But the money was far better compared to working a regular pharmacy job. Being hourly I also maxed my workload while on contract so would routinely average 55 to 60 hours per week depending on the contract.\n\n# 1.2 Current Role\n\nIn 2025 my position is with a state government: $155k including 12.75% super. I received a $30k sign on bonus and will get a $20k retention bonus at 12 & 24 months. Accommodation is included as the location is a rural site. I work 38h Monday - Friday with an unpaid hour for lunch! The new work/life balance was great for 2 months. Then I started locuming on weekends because I\u2019m addicted to the hourly rate! Currently working 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on a Sunday for $110/h gross. So I\u2019m 52h/week across 7 days which is manageable but I (mostly my gf) would really like a day off. I\u2019m currently looking at dropping my two weekend shifts and negotiating a 14 hour shift on a Saturday at a new pharmacy for the $110/h rate! Same 52h but across 6 days. Perfect.\n\n# 2.0 Expenses and Savings Rate\n\n|Item|FY '22|FY '23|FY '24|FY '25|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Expenses**|**$38,906**|**$28,097**|**$35,143**|**$36,944**|\n|Debits|$7,391|$9,140|$3,556|$76|\n|Credit Card|$5,184|$9,207|$9,561|$19,631|\n|Joint A/c|$6,704|$9,750|$8,809|$6,481|\n|Int\u2019 Travel|$19,627|$0|$13,217|$10,756|\n||||||\n|**Post-tax SR**|**23.3%**|**77.8%**|**75.7%**|**76.3%**|\n\n# 2.1 Expenses in my 20s\n\nThrough uni (2010-2013) I worked casually at a pharmacy. Was paid quite a bit for an 18-21 year old pharmacy student so was pretty happy! Never really saved anything or invested at this stage. Lucky to live at home through my uni degree rent free. Spent all my cash buying 3 progressively more expensive second hand cars over 5 years which all needed hella repairs. Spent the rest of my money on house hold goods, food, booze, partying, drugs, domestic travel, dating, fashion, whatever. When I started working my pharmacy internship in 2014 I was paying $150/w in rent to my parents. This continued until I moved out in 2016 and had a mortgage with adult bills. Wasn\u2019t much left over after budgeting for bills and mortgage. You can see my income that year took a big dip! Was paid far more as a student than an intern!\n\n# 2.2 Adult Expenses\n\n2017 you can see my income increased a lot when I started locum work. So of course I dialled up the spend! I\u2019d converted my PPOR to an IP as I left my home town to start work on the road. So from 2017 until January 2025 I have never paid rent or a PPOR mortgage repayment. I negotiated contracts with employers to cover accommodation and usually travel costs. Sometimes it was caravan parks or motels, sometimes AirBnBs, the owner\u2019s homes or hotels. In between contracts we camp, stay with friends/family, overseas travel or book domestic accommodation. Currently I split $250/w with my gf for a room in a city I travel to for work on weekends. Having very little housing costs obviously has kept my living expenses extremely low. Not feasible forever but great to help me increase my savings rate and get a head start on investing.\n\nFortunate to have met my partner traveling in 2019 who was also on board with FI! This year she is now CoastFI on her overseas assets. We share all our living and travel expenses through a joint bank account we contribute to equally. I apportion the property portfolio equity, debt and cashflow 50/50 with her in our individual NW numbers. We have and will continue to use a mix of our cash for deposits and expenses. In the event of a breakup we will split the property assets 50/50 after paying out our individual contributions and cash in the offsets. All our other assets are separate.\n\n# 2.3 Savings Rate\n\nI keep spending pretty tight these days but I LOVE paying for convenience. I love not having to be stressed about the price of catching an Uber/Taxi, price of groceries, or buying/replacing something that I want when I need it. I don\u2019t bother tracking my spending too closely. I do have a budget that I update every year with my big known expenses and guestimates for fuel, food and discretionary spending etc but I don\u2019t reconcile it. The budgeted expenses come out pretty close to my top line spend in my Expenses/SR table so I don\u2019t feel the need to get more granular. The only thing I itemise further is international travel because that\u2019s a big part of my FI life! Savings rate has been >70% since I\u2019ve been living life thru the FI lens so I CBFd scrutinising my expenses any further.\n\n# 2.4 Lifestyle Creep\n\nI do love dropping a bomb on holidays though! 2018/19 spent $20.2k in SE Asia for 9 months meeting my gf at the end of it. 2022 I spent $19.6k on 4 months across 8 US states and Brazil. 2024 I spent $13.2k on 10 weeks in South America. 2025 I spent $10.7k on 4 weeks in the US.\u00a0\n\nAlready we've inflated our travel lifestyle by booking Airbnbs/hotels in our desired areas instead of hostels in a cheaper location. We book flights with convenient departure/arrival times even if they're more expensive. We have a spend-like-we\u2019re-rich rule on holiday to help us really enjoy ourselves. I'd love to be in a position to travel more often, upgrade to business class for flights >5 hours, dial up the luxury a lil in the accommodation we book, travel to more expensive locations, hire a private driver/tour guide, ball out on experiences in incredible locations etc. The lifestyle creep will come easy so I need to grow my NW to support the spend I want to have.\n\n# 3.0 Investing\n\n# Net Worth Summary\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Net Worth**|**$251,919**|**$390,401**|**$473,245**|**$708,486**|\n|$ increase||$138,482|$82,845|$229,240|\n|% increase||54.97%|21.22%|48.44%|\n\n# Assets\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Super|$58,227|$97,909|$134,719|$213,047|\n|Equities|$65,517|$59,176|$78,007|$146,269|\n|Property|$217,000|$206,000|$470,000|$762,500|\n|Crypto|$31,754|$56,260|$79,649|$104,036|\n|Cash|$29,607|$122,965|$88,600|$47,722|\n|Car|$9,125|$9,125|$8,000|$6,000|\n|**Total**|**$411,229**|**$551,435**|**$858,976**|**$1,273,574**|\n\n# Debt\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mortgage|$158,500|$154,995|$382,766|$567,200|\n|Credit Card|$810|$6,039|$2,964|$3,888|\n|**Total**|**$159,310**|**$161,034**|**$385,730**|**$571,088**|\n\nn.b.

From 2017 I had been \u2018investing\u2019 in assets with no real plan: penny stocks, single stocks, oil futures, crypto and some thematic ETFs. Clearly had employed zero education and strategy on how to invest in any asset class.\u00a0Had some winners and losers but ended up with a modest CGT bill. The gain pales in comparison to the returns I would have received by buying another IP or investing in my Super and ETFs since 2017 instead.\n\n# 3.2 Getting Educated\n\nIn 2022 I came back from another big, expensive, overseas holiday. I had spent all my cash and a my mix of random assets were in decline. I was again canvasing for some lucrative contracts to fill up the bank account. I knew I had to be more intentional with my money if I wanted to continue this lifestyle of travel and part-time work. I was getting into podcasts at this time and had been writing down a few book titles about investing, personal finance and self-help. So I dove into that!\n\nAfter my learning and finding r/FIAustralia and some other Subreddits I had discovered the 4% guideline and NW calculations. I was surprised to find that my NW was a touch over $250k, albeit spread across a bunch of random asset classes. Seeing that number at 29 years old was really motivating. I knew I could accelerate this journey by earning more. You can see from earnings FY23-FY25 my income increased a lot. I took less holidays but my hourly rate as a locum had also kept increasing. During downtime at work and after hours I spent an obscene amount of time devouring podcasts, books, articles, paid courses, webinars, websites, YT videos, Instagram reels, TikToks and Reddit learning as much as I could about investing, personal finance and property. I sold almost all my random mix of assets back to cash then I came up with my plan:\u00a0Super, property, ETFs, crypto. In that order.\n\n# 3.3 Super Philosophy\n\nI love Super. There is no better tax advantaged way to invest your money for building wealth. Yes Super is locked away until retirement age but that\u2019s the whole point of investing: allowing time to compound your capital by reinvesting the dividends while you add to the pile. By contributing to Super early you are allowing those extra tax dollars saved and contributed capital the longest time possible to compound, tax free!! If something catastrophic happens where I can no longer work and all my money is \u201clocked up\u201d in Super there are early access schemes, income protection, TPD insurance, government welfare programs, other assets, family and friends etc. There are myriad options to support you in the worst-case scenario instead of ignoring Super.\n\nYou really need to take care of yourself for when you\u2019re elderly and too broken to keep working. You do this by jacking your Super to the tits ASAP and then you can start bringing your retirement age back by investing outside of Super.\u00a0If you can\u2019t afford to top your Super up to the current $30k limit after your employer Super Guarantee (SG) you\u2019re probably not earning enough to retire that early anyway. Which means you should definitely prioritise Super. I love [this article](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/how-much-to-save-inside-vs-outside-super/#stages) from\u00a0[PassiveInvestingAustralia.com](http://PassiveInvestingAustralia.com)\u00a0showing how prioritising your Super as an investment will actually help you retire sooner as a low income earner. If you are a high earner you can afford to top up to $30k. You should definitely prioritise Super for the 15% (and 30% DIV293) tax rate which will be miles better than your marginal tax rates. \u00a0\n\n# 3.4 My Super Investment\n\n**$213,046.51** | **31.15% of NW**\n\nHaving the SG since I started working as a casual pharmacy student in 2011 meant I had a good head start on my balance. In 2020 I took out the COVID relief $20k. In hindsight I should have left it in there of course. Especially considering I left it in cash for over 6 months, missing the big V shaped recovery and new all time highs! Oops. In FY23 my income had increased a lot and I was looking for tax deductions. Checking MyGov, I had $90k of unused concessional contributions! I am spreading those tax deductions over 3-4 years to use them up consecutively before they expire after 5 years. I use concessional contributions and salary sacrificing to max my yearly cap and fill up previous unused caps.\n\nThrough my income and investment income in the future I always see myself maxing my contribution limit to Super. I may over invest in Super but I\u2019m not looking to retire ASAP and I plan to give a lot of my wealth away before I die. Investing in Super will give me a huge pot that could help a lot of people! I also plan on maintaining my pharmacy registration over the coming decades. I am required to work an annual 150 hours minimum. Perpetually CoastFI!\n\nI hate that DIV296 tax applies to unrealised gains. I don\u2019t mind taxing Super more above $3m on realised gains though. No one needs that much in Super. Based on my projections I will be close to that balance in 27 years at a traditional retirement age.\n\n# 3.5 Property Philosophy\n\nTalk about a tax deduction: if I love Super, then I\u2019m HORNY FOR PROPERTY! I actually don\u2019t love negative gearing though. Losing money to save your marginal tax rate is an absurd strategy but that's what we're stuck with in Australia. Can\u2019t wait to get my portfolio to neutral territory. I do love to claim the non-cash expenses like depreciation though! Leveraging to buy property is the best way to compound your capital IMO. You have way more control over your assets, can manufacture equity and directly increase the yields. You don\u2019t have that level of finesse over companies in the share market (unless you\u2019re getting a board seat lol). The massive low-cost leverage you can apply to your capital by investing in property makes it a superior investment option to build wealth compared to the light leverage you can get with equities. I think debt recycling is a really sexy strategy too and I can\u2019t wait to utilise that when we buy a home!\n\nThe reason property was second on my list of priorities over ETFs is two-fold, though related. Firstly, with leverage you can control a large dollar value of assets in the market. You want to benefit from the maximum amount of assets growing in the market for the most time possible. Secondly: government mandated inflation at 2-3% erodes the value of the debt. So you need to take on the debt and buy the assets ASAP to allow positive compounding on the largest amount of assets and negative compounding on your debt through inflation! This move was all about time. Maximising the time you control these huge assets with maximum leverage will compound better returns.\n\n# 3.6 My Property Investment\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|IPs|2.5|\n|Total Value|$1,525,000|\n|Total Debt|$1,134,400|\n|Net Value|$390,600|\n|Leverage Ratio|74%|\n|Offset Account|$47,722|\n|**Net Value**|**$438,322**|\n\n# Profit / Loss Statement\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Income|$74,620|\n|Total Expenses|$104,781|\n|Offset Gain Back|$2,983|\n|**Estimated Cashflow before tax**|**\u2013$27,178**|\n|Depreciation|$17,128|\n|Accountant Expense|$2,500|\n|Land Tax|$0|\n|Tax Rate %|39%|\n|**Estimated Cashflow after tax**|**\u2013$11,424**|\n\n# Blended Interest Rate                                                       6.25%\n\n**Equity share of $195 300 is 27.65% of NW.**\n\nIn 2016 I grossly overpaid on a house and land package in a Townsville suburb with lots of developable land AND in a flood zone! I\u2019m very nervous every wet season in NQld. But it didn\u2019t flood in 2019 (just) or during this year\u2019s flood event in March.\u00a0I knew nothing about investing in property evidenced in the fact that I was negative equity until it finally grew enough 8 years later to negate the premium I paid the developer and builder. I built this house with my then gf and still own it 50/50 as tenants in common. I put in $23k cash, she $13k, and we were $405k all in. Current valuation 600k so a pretty poor effort over 8.5 years especially as the growth only came the last 18 months. It is a 7%+ gross yield on purchase now so it has been positively geared last two FYs at least. I plan to add a 4th bedroom by enclosing a 2nd living area to add an estimated 80-90k of equity based on comparables in the suburb and selling it in 2026. I will unlock the equity as cash, get the borrowing capacity back and dissolve the complex loan product I hold over the property with my ex. I need to check with my accountant but I think I can claim the 6 year rule on partial gains up to 2022 as I haven\u2019t claimed another PPOR. I didn\u2019t get it valued at the 6 year mark though so this might prove difficult if it\u2019s even possible!\n\nSecond property was also purchased in Townsville. May \u201824, 10% down at 450k with 5.4% gross yield, cash deposit. Bank valuation this June: 575k!! Third property in Mackay. Purchased September \u201824, 10% down at 570k with 5.02% gross yield cash and equity from property #1. Bank valuation this June: $650k!! So there\u2019s almost 400k of equity in the portfolio ATM. As a pharmacist I can get 90% LVR lend no LMI without being punished on the rates. It\u2019s a great lending product and very happy to be able to take advantage! I am pre-approved for 600k more in my personal name with this loan product. I plan to use this to buy in one of three locations: Lavington, Albury; South Grafton, NSW or Bendigo, VIC. Suburb medians are 500-570k and growing with demand and supply side data metrics looking promising while gross yields of 5%+ are achievable.\n\n# 3.7 Future Property Plans\n\nI\u2019m close to my Qld land tax threshold in my personal name and want to diversify states. WA and SA have had a lot of growth and Victoria has a few investors head winds: They have a low land tax threshold (50k!) and have hostile landlord policies. There\u2019s lots of developable land down that way so will have less of a supply constraint long term compared to other markets.\u00a0There\u2019s still potential for growth but I think there\u2019s better opportunities in NSW and Qld.\n\nGoing forward I will need to utilise trust structures to preserve my borrowing capacity. Broker says I\u2019ll be tapped out with the majors after #4 but I will still be able to lend with 2nd and 3rd tier lenders, especially if I let go of property #1. My 5th purchase is going to be a commercial property. I will then pigeon pair that inside the same trust with another growth property. This will help me pay off the debt of the commercial property in the future while keeping the trust positive through this holding period. The banks can disregard the debt inside that trust if it\u2019s positive cash flow and I can lend again based on my personal capacity. Strategy has been fleshed out with my broker and tax agent. It\u2019s risky obviously but damn I just love leverage.\n\nI don\u2019t have a goal for portfolio size, equity position or cashflow, but looking at growth on a $4.5m assets base in a [Future Value calculator](https://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html?cyearsv=30&cstartingprinciplev=4%2C500%2C000&cinterestratev=5&ccontributeamountv=0&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=Calculate#calresult) looks pretty good to me! Achievable too once I move into commercial property assets where I will be buying in higher price points.\n\n# 3.8 My ETF Investments\n\n**20.71% of NW**\n\n|Ticker|Allocation|Value|Contributions|%ROI|$ROI|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|VGS|61.24%|$89,570|$52,930|69.22%|$36,640|\n|VAS|21.96%|$32,121|$20,291|58.30%|$11,830|\n|GHFF|16.80%|$24,578|$21,879|12.34%|$2,699|\n|**Total**|**100.00%**|**$146,269**|**$95,100**|**53.81%**|**$51,170**|\n\nI\u2019m actually most obsessed with equities. Little bits of money that grow and pay you dividends. The worst thing that happens is they go down in price! Then you can buy more or use the income from the investments to buy more! So accessible, liquid, powerful. It has been third on my list of priorities as I gathered deposits and cashed in on Super deductions. Cashflow can get tight with my Super/Property strategy and I\u2019m not very liquid. So storing cash and extra savings in ETFs is my new drug! It really adds a lot of liquidity and accessible reserves to my portfolio. I burnt myself on some fun thematics like YOLO, ARKK and HCLN over the years. When I sold most of my assets to restructure my finances in 2022 I was down 24k on those. Sold out of my oil futures, single stocks as well (wish I\u2019d kept Palantir!). Went all in on an 80/20 VGS/VAS portfolio. Recently though I have been really excited about GHHF. It has a higher Oz content than I\u2019d like at 37% so I\u2019m continuing to buy VGS as well to keep me within my desired allocation. I haven\u2019t decided yet what ratio I want of leveraged ETFs but if I know myself, it will be as close to 100% as that mathematical asymptote will let me get lol. Leverage is just so sexy the way it juices returns! \u00a0\n\n# 3.9 My Crypto Investments\n\n**$104,036.11** | **14.73% of NW** | **BCH(69%)/BTC(18%)/ETH(13%)**\n\nI am a huge fan of transparent and immutable blockchain technology. It has a lot of applications. I\u2019m still waiting for the killer app, but it isn\u2019t BTC. I bought BTC in 2017 and also sold it in 2017 because it had gone up a lot and\u00a0transactions were congested and fees were so high it was unusable as peer to peer cash. I thought it would crash because it was useless; and still is with high fees and handicapped transaction volume. Big regrets tho lol.\n\nIf you know anything about crypto I didn\u2019t sell before the BCH hard fork at least. So I got all those coins for free! Which forked twice more for BSV and XEC. In 2022 during the great restructuring I sold the latter two hard forks for free money and also 12 shitcoins I had accumulated. I kept all my BCH and add to it regularly. For me it\u2019s the most useful crypto. You can send any amount instantly, peer to peer for less than a cent to anyone, anywhere in the world! The transaction is always confirmed in the next block for immutability. I love it. Couldn\u2019t resist DCAing back into BTC because damn that thing just keeps going up! I also invest in ETH. Crystallised $34k in gains from crypto over the years so Ive only got $24k of capital in my crypto portfolio.\n\nI think there\u2019s a place for crypto in anyone\u2019s portfolio but it has to be about a project you know and think has utility. My allocation is a little high at 14.73% relative to NW. Adding to my other assets will make my crypto allocation a smaller part of my NW over time. I don\u2019t expect the growth to be as explosive going forward so it should balance out soon. Aiming for 10% allocation of my NW.\n\n# 4.0\u00a0Future Plans and Goals\n\nHaving average expenses of <40kpa means I\u2019m not far from my FIRE number! However I expect my spend to increase significantly over the next decade. We will eventually start renting a \u201cdream home\u201d or purchase a PPOR, dial up the spend on travel/hobbies and charitable giving, and setup an awesome camping rig which will have significant ownership costs. I also love a bit of luxury so my FI number is likely much higher. I guess my minimum goal is around $1.5-1.9m which is 60-76kp on a 4% SWR. I still have another 2-3 years of building my property portfolio so will need to continue working full-time for servicing. Then I\u2019m feeling a CoastFI vibe while my assets compound for me. I will work a mandated 150 hours per year minimum to maintain my pharmacy registration and fluctuate my workload as I need. The question I\u2019m mulling over is what does that CoastFI job look like over the coming years?\n\nI could easily stay with this government job as it\u2019s been very relaxing and well paid with free accommodation. The rural site is not my gf\u2019s favourite place though so I probably can\u2019t stay for more than 18 months. Have been keeping an eye on other state health jobs for internal transfer. I could go back to locuming. I have a great network and there\u2019s still plenty of work on but my gf is definitely over it having traveled with me for 4 years! It\u2019s also a more difficult lending landscape for servicing. The other option is getting into a business partnership. Having met dozens of pharmacy owners over the years I have been offered 4 partnerships. Pharmacies usually return 10-15% on owners equity! You need to be a pharmacist to own a pharmacy so there\u2019s less competition to get in. It\u2019s also a protected industry from competitors and both sides of government are pro locally-owned community pharmacies compared to the corporate pharmacy business model you see in the US, for example. It\u2019s an enticing prospect. It would be a challenge and the pay off on the back end will be great into the future. I don\u2019t know if I have it in me though when I can get to where I\u2019m going on my current \u201ceasy\u201d path. Something to contemplate as I learn and grow as a person and an investor!\u00a0\n\n# 5.0 Resources\n\nIf you want a list of resources that I liked the most from my learning I share it regularly in subs.

          "selftext": "I once worked in a call centre position for a \"middle-man\" company that assisted in retaining monthly donors to some major charities (National Breast Cancer Foundation, McGrath Foundation, Seeing Eye Dogs, I forgot the rest but others were also major ones).\n\nAll we would do are 3 minute calls, after you signed up to support a foundation in a shopping centre, verifying your details and clarifying your commitment. At this point, we would be the \"empathetic salesman\" and adjust your donation amount incase you feel you over committed. But again, the goal is retainment.\n\nIn the fine print, that no one ever reads, it says that 97% of your donation for the first 2 years goes to our company and after those 2 years your money goes to the charity itself (I dont recall if that was 100% to the charity or not). Our company operated all across Australia and even started operating the front lines trying to get people signed up. The line they would have to say is, \"The X foundation really does benefit the most from donations of 2 years or more\" and then slap on a slogan at the end which is given to us by the foundation themself. We go by scripts for just about every question you have and the answers are all to entice you to stay donating your money.\n\nFinance wise, even the people who stand in a shopping mall asking you to do monthly donations may not even work directly for that foundation. You are allowed to ask if they get commission (they do), and how much of the money goes to the charity, but that doesn't mean people won't lie.\n\nMore of a moral finance thing than a tax purposes one here. I quite after a month. If you donate directly through their website, you skip all the outside dodgy-ness.",

I would never log into my bank on an unknown computer, and 95% access my bank using my phone. \n\nI thought they could have gotten access through my Google account, but ive checked the activity logs and there has been nothing through my Google account from when I went to bed until I woke up. \n\nA bit concerned. Has anyone else experienced this and can offer some advice? \n\nThank you",

I graduated a 4 year pharmacy degree in 2013 and interned for a year in 2014 at 22 years old. In 2017 I completed my MBA and also got a cash gift of $20k from my parents. Accrued $58k of HECS debt including $7,300 of indexation that took 10 years to pay off by 2024.\n\n# 1.1 Career Progression\n\nI worked in my home town for 3 years after graduation in a 9-5 before starting locum work in 2017 when my income took off. I was chasing the highest paid contracts in new locations I hadn\u2019t traveled to before. I would cover maternity/paternity contracts, owner/staff annual leave, busy holiday periods etc. This work coupled my thrill of making money with my desire to travel and see new places. I have worked in over 30 towns/cities in Australia and visited/camped in scores more in between contracts. Contracts could range from 2 weeks to 3 months.\n\nI love my job! I\u2019m a huge people person so being able to help people with their minor or major health care needs really makes me fulfilled! I have been very lucky to happen into a profession that I enjoy and has had really good wage growth.\u00a0\n\nIt was tough and stressful working as a contractor for 8 years under an ABN without annual/sick leave: sourcing contracts, negotiating contracts, syncing work calendars with social and personal commitments, living out of a cars and suitcases, driving thousands of kilometres to new jobs, difficult lending landscape, lumpy income, being away from friends and family etc. But the money was far better compared to working a regular pharmacy job. Being hourly I also maxed my workload while on contract so would routinely average 55 to 60 hours per week depending on the contract.\n\n# 1.2 Current Role\n\nIn 2025 my position is with a state government: $155k including 12.75% super. I received a $30k sign on bonus and will get a $20k retention bonus at 12 & 24 months. Accommodation is included as the location is a rural site. I work 38h Monday - Friday with an unpaid hour for lunch! The new work/life balance was great for 2 months. Then I started locuming on weekends because I\u2019m addicted to the hourly rate! Currently working 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on a Sunday for $110/h gross. So I\u2019m 52h/week across 7 days which is manageable but I (mostly my gf) would really like a day off. I\u2019m currently looking at dropping my two weekend shifts and negotiating a 14 hour shift on a Saturday at a new pharmacy for the $110/h rate! Same 52h but across 6 days. Perfect.\n\n# 2.0 Expenses and Savings Rate\n\n|Item|FY '22|FY '23|FY '24|FY '25|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Expenses**|**$38,906**|**$28,097**|**$35,143**|**$36,944**|\n|Debits|$7,391|$9,140|$3,556|$76|\n|Credit Card|$5,184|$9,207|$9,561|$19,631|\n|Joint A/c|$6,704|$9,750|$8,809|$6,481|\n|Int\u2019 Travel|$19,627|$0|$13,217|$10,756|\n||||||\n|**Post-tax SR**|**23.3%**|**77.8%**|**75.7%**|**76.3%**|\n\n# 2.1 Expenses in my 20s\n\nThrough uni (2010-2013) I worked casually at a pharmacy. Was paid quite a bit for an 18-21 year old pharmacy student so was pretty happy! Never really saved anything or invested at this stage. Lucky to live at home through my uni degree rent free. Spent all my cash buying 3 progressively more expensive second hand cars over 5 years which all needed hella repairs. Spent the rest of my money on house hold goods, food, booze, partying, drugs, domestic travel, dating, fashion, whatever. When I started working my pharmacy internship in 2014 I was paying $150/w in rent to my parents. This continued until I moved out in 2016 and had a mortgage with adult bills. Wasn\u2019t much left over after budgeting for bills and mortgage. You can see my income that year took a big dip! Was paid far more as a student than an intern!\n\n# 2.2 Adult Expenses\n\n2017 you can see my income increased a lot when I started locum work. So of course I dialled up the spend! I\u2019d converted my PPOR to an IP as I left my home town to start work on the road. So from 2017 until January 2025 I have never paid rent or a PPOR mortgage repayment. I negotiated contracts with employers to cover accommodation and usually travel costs. Sometimes it was caravan parks or motels, sometimes AirBnBs, the owner\u2019s homes or hotels. In between contracts we camp, stay with friends/family, overseas travel or book domestic accommodation. Currently I split $250/w with my gf for a room in a city I travel to for work on weekends. Having very little housing costs obviously has kept my living expenses extremely low. Not feasible forever but great to help me increase my savings rate and get a head start on investing.\n\nFortunate to have met my partner traveling in 2019 who was also on board with FI! This year she is now CoastFI on her overseas assets. We share all our living and travel expenses through a joint bank account we contribute to equally. I apportion the property portfolio equity, debt and cashflow 50/50 with her in our individual NW numbers. We have and will continue to use a mix of our cash for deposits and expenses. In the event of a breakup we will split the property assets 50/50 after paying out our individual contributions and cash in the offsets. All our other assets are separate.\n\n# 2.3 Savings Rate\n\nI keep spending pretty tight these days but I LOVE paying for convenience. I love not having to be stressed about the price of catching an Uber/Taxi, price of groceries, or buying/replacing something that I want when I need it. I don\u2019t bother tracking my spending too closely. I do have a budget that I update every year with my big known expenses and guestimates for fuel, food and discretionary spending etc but I don\u2019t reconcile it. The budgeted expenses come out pretty close to my top line spend in my Expenses/SR table so I don\u2019t feel the need to get more granular. The only thing I itemise further is international travel because that\u2019s a big part of my FI life! Savings rate has been >70% since I\u2019ve been living life thru the FI lens so I CBFd scrutinising my expenses any further.\n\n# 2.4 Lifestyle Creep\n\nI do love dropping a bomb on holidays though! 2018/19 spent $20.2k in SE Asia for 9 months meeting my gf at the end of it. 2022 I spent $19.6k on 4 months across 8 US states and Brazil. 2024 I spent $13.2k on 10 weeks in South America. 2025 I spent $10.7k on 4 weeks in the US.\u00a0\n\nAlready we've inflated our travel lifestyle by booking Airbnbs/hotels in our desired areas instead of hostels in a cheaper location. We book flights with convenient departure/arrival times even if they're more expensive. We have a spend-like-we\u2019re-rich rule on holiday to help us really enjoy ourselves. I'd love to be in a position to travel more often, upgrade to business class for flights >5 hours, dial up the luxury a lil in the accommodation we book, travel to more expensive locations, hire a private driver/tour guide, ball out on experiences in incredible locations etc. The lifestyle creep will come easy so I need to grow my NW to support the spend I want to have.\n\n# 3.0 Investing\n\n# Net Worth Summary\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Net Worth**|**$251,919**|**$390,401**|**$473,245**|**$708,486**|\n|$ increase||$138,482|$82,845|$229,240|\n|% increase||54.97%|21.22%|48.44%|\n\n# Assets\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Super|$58,227|$97,909|$134,719|$213,047|\n|Equities|$65,517|$59,176|$78,007|$146,269|\n|Property|$217,000|$206,000|$470,000|$762,500|\n|Crypto|$31,754|$56,260|$79,649|$104,036|\n|Cash|$29,607|$122,965|$88,600|$47,722|\n|Car|$9,125|$9,125|$8,000|$6,000|\n|**Total**|**$411,229**|**$551,435**|**$858,976**|**$1,273,574**|\n\n# Debt\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mortgage|$158,500|$154,995|$382,766|$567,200|\n|Credit Card|$810|$6,039|$2,964|$3,888|\n|**Total**|**$159,310**|**$161,034**|**$385,730**|**$571,088**|\n\nn.b.

From 2017 I had been \u2018investing\u2019 in assets with no real plan: penny stocks, single stocks, oil futures, crypto and some thematic ETFs. Clearly had employed zero education and strategy on how to invest in any asset class.\u00a0Had some winners and losers but ended up with a modest CGT bill. The gain pales in comparison to the returns I would have received by buying another IP or investing in my Super and ETFs since 2017 instead.\n\n# 3.2 Getting Educated\n\nIn 2022 I came back from another big, expensive, overseas holiday. I had spent all my cash and a my mix of random assets were in decline. I was again canvasing for some lucrative contracts to fill up the bank account. I knew I had to be more intentional with my money if I wanted to continue this lifestyle of travel and part-time work. I was getting into podcasts at this time and had been writing down a few book titles about investing, personal finance and self-help. So I dove into that!\n\nAfter my learning and finding r/FIAustralia and some other Subreddits I had discovered the 4% guideline and NW calculations. I was surprised to find that my NW was a touch over $250k, albeit spread across a bunch of random asset classes. Seeing that number at 29 years old was really motivating. I knew I could accelerate this journey by earning more. You can see from earnings FY23-FY25 my income increased a lot. I took less holidays but my hourly rate as a locum had also kept increasing. During downtime at work and after hours I spent an obscene amount of time devouring podcasts, books, articles, paid courses, webinars, websites, YT videos, Instagram reels, TikToks and Reddit learning as much as I could about investing, personal finance and property. I sold almost all my random mix of assets back to cash then I came up with my plan:\u00a0Super, property, ETFs, crypto. In that order.\n\n# 3.3 Super Philosophy\n\nI love Super. There is no better tax advantaged way to invest your money for building wealth. Yes Super is locked away until retirement age but that\u2019s the whole point of investing: allowing time to compound your capital by reinvesting the dividends while you add to the pile. By contributing to Super early you are allowing those extra tax dollars saved and contributed capital the longest time possible to compound, tax free!! If something catastrophic happens where I can no longer work and all my money is \u201clocked up\u201d in Super there are early access schemes, income protection, TPD insurance, government welfare programs, other assets, family and friends etc. There are myriad options to support you in the worst-case scenario instead of ignoring Super.\n\nYou really need to take care of yourself for when you\u2019re elderly and too broken to keep working. You do this by jacking your Super to the tits ASAP and then you can start bringing your retirement age back by investing outside of Super.\u00a0If you can\u2019t afford to top your Super up to the current $30k limit after your employer Super Guarantee (SG) you\u2019re probably not earning enough to retire that early anyway. Which means you should definitely prioritise Super. I love [this article](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/how-much-to-save-inside-vs-outside-super/#stages) from\u00a0[PassiveInvestingAustralia.com](http://PassiveInvestingAustralia.com)\u00a0showing how prioritising your Super as an investment will actually help you retire sooner as a low income earner. If you are a high earner you can afford to top up to $30k. You should definitely prioritise Super for the 15% (and 30% DIV293) tax rate which will be miles better than your marginal tax rates. \u00a0\n\n# 3.4 My Super Investment\n\n**$213,046.51** | **31.15% of NW**\n\nHaving the SG since I started working as a casual pharmacy student in 2011 meant I had a good head start on my balance. In 2020 I took out the COVID relief $20k. In hindsight I should have left it in there of course. Especially considering I left it in cash for over 6 months, missing the big V shaped recovery and new all time highs! Oops. In FY23 my income had increased a lot and I was looking for tax deductions. Checking MyGov, I had $90k of unused concessional contributions! I am spreading those tax deductions over 3-4 years to use them up consecutively before they expire after 5 years. I use concessional contributions and salary sacrificing to max my yearly cap and fill up previous unused caps.\n\nThrough my income and investment income in the future I always see myself maxing my contribution limit to Super. I may over invest in Super but I\u2019m not looking to retire ASAP and I plan to give a lot of my wealth away before I die. Investing in Super will give me a huge pot that could help a lot of people! I also plan on maintaining my pharmacy registration over the coming decades. I am required to work an annual 150 hours minimum. Perpetually CoastFI!\n\nI hate that DIV296 tax applies to unrealised gains. I don\u2019t mind taxing Super more above $3m on realised gains though. No one needs that much in Super. Based on my projections I will be close to that balance in 27 years at a traditional retirement age.\n\n# 3.5 Property Philosophy\n\nTalk about a tax deduction: if I love Super, then I\u2019m HORNY FOR PROPERTY! I actually don\u2019t love negative gearing though. Losing money to save your marginal tax rate is an absurd strategy but that's what we're stuck with in Australia. Can\u2019t wait to get my portfolio to neutral territory. I do love to claim the non-cash expenses like depreciation though! Leveraging to buy property is the best way to compound your capital IMO. You have way more control over your assets, can manufacture equity and directly increase the yields. You don\u2019t have that level of finesse over companies in the share market (unless you\u2019re getting a board seat lol). The massive low-cost leverage you can apply to your capital by investing in property makes it a superior investment option to build wealth compared to the light leverage you can get with equities. I think debt recycling is a really sexy strategy too and I can\u2019t wait to utilise that when we buy a home!\n\nThe reason property was second on my list of priorities over ETFs is two-fold, though related. Firstly, with leverage you can control a large dollar value of assets in the market. You want to benefit from the maximum amount of assets growing in the market for the most time possible. Secondly: government mandated inflation at 2-3% erodes the value of the debt. So you need to take on the debt and buy the assets ASAP to allow positive compounding on the largest amount of assets and negative compounding on your debt through inflation! This move was all about time. Maximising the time you control these huge assets with maximum leverage will compound better returns.\n\n# 3.6 My Property Investment\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|IPs|2.5|\n|Total Value|$1,525,000|\n|Total Debt|$1,134,400|\n|Net Value|$390,600|\n|Leverage Ratio|74%|\n|Offset Account|$47,722|\n|**Net Value**|**$438,322**|\n\n# Profit / Loss Statement\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Income|$74,620|\n|Total Expenses|$104,781|\n|Offset Gain Back|$2,983|\n|**Estimated Cashflow before tax**|**\u2013$27,178**|\n|Depreciation|$17,128|\n|Accountant Expense|$2,500|\n|Land Tax|$0|\n|Tax Rate %|39%|\n|**Estimated Cashflow after tax**|**\u2013$11,424**|\n\n# Blended Interest Rate                                                       6.25%\n\n**Equity share of $195 300 is 27.65% of NW.**\n\nIn 2016 I grossly overpaid on a house and land package in a Townsville suburb with lots of developable land AND in a flood zone! I\u2019m very nervous every wet season in NQld. But it didn\u2019t flood in 2019 (just) or during this year\u2019s flood event in March.\u00a0I knew nothing about investing in property evidenced in the fact that I was negative equity until it finally grew enough 8 years later to negate the premium I paid the developer and builder. I built this house with my then gf and still own it 50/50 as tenants in common. I put in $23k cash, she $13k, and we were $405k all in. Current valuation 600k so a pretty poor effort over 8.5 years especially as the growth only came the last 18 months. It is a 7%+ gross yield on purchase now so it has been positively geared last two FYs at least. I plan to add a 4th bedroom by enclosing a 2nd living area to add an estimated 80-90k of equity based on comparables in the suburb and selling it in 2026. I will unlock the equity as cash, get the borrowing capacity back and dissolve the complex loan product I hold over the property with my ex. I need to check with my accountant but I think I can claim the 6 year rule on partial gains up to 2022 as I haven\u2019t claimed another PPOR. I didn\u2019t get it valued at the 6 year mark though so this might prove difficult if it\u2019s even possible!\n\nSecond property was also purchased in Townsville. May \u201824, 10% down at 450k with 5.4% gross yield, cash deposit. Bank valuation this June: 575k!! Third property in Mackay. Purchased September \u201824, 10% down at 570k with 5.02% gross yield cash and equity from property #1. Bank valuation this June: $650k!! So there\u2019s almost 400k of equity in the portfolio ATM. As a pharmacist I can get 90% LVR lend no LMI without being punished on the rates. It\u2019s a great lending product and very happy to be able to take advantage! I am pre-approved for 600k more in my personal name with this loan product. I plan to use this to buy in one of three locations: Lavington, Albury; South Grafton, NSW or Bendigo, VIC. Suburb medians are 500-570k and growing with demand and supply side data metrics looking promising while gross yields of 5%+ are achievable.\n\n# 3.7 Future Property Plans\n\nI\u2019m close to my Qld land tax threshold in my personal name and want to diversify states. WA and SA have had a lot of growth and Victoria has a few investors head winds: They have a low land tax threshold (50k!) and have hostile landlord policies. There\u2019s lots of developable land down that way so will have less of a supply constraint long term compared to other markets.\u00a0There\u2019s still potential for growth but I think there\u2019s better opportunities in NSW and Qld.\n\nGoing forward I will need to utilise trust structures to preserve my borrowing capacity. Broker says I\u2019ll be tapped out with the majors after #4 but I will still be able to lend with 2nd and 3rd tier lenders, especially if I let go of property #1. My 5th purchase is going to be a commercial property. I will then pigeon pair that inside the same trust with another growth property. This will help me pay off the debt of the commercial property in the future while keeping the trust positive through this holding period. The banks can disregard the debt inside that trust if it\u2019s positive cash flow and I can lend again based on my personal capacity. Strategy has been fleshed out with my broker and tax agent. It\u2019s risky obviously but damn I just love leverage.\n\nI don\u2019t have a goal for portfolio size, equity position or cashflow, but looking at growth on a $4.5m assets base in a [Future Value calculator](https://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html?cyearsv=30&cstartingprinciplev=4%2C500%2C000&cinterestratev=5&ccontributeamountv=0&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=Calculate#calresult) looks pretty good to me! Achievable too once I move into commercial property assets where I will be buying in higher price points.\n\n# 3.8 My ETF Investments\n\n**20.71% of NW**\n\n|Ticker|Allocation|Value|Contributions|%ROI|$ROI|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|VGS|61.24%|$89,570|$52,930|69.22%|$36,640|\n|VAS|21.96%|$32,121|$20,291|58.30%|$11,830|\n|GHFF|16.80%|$24,578|$21,879|12.34%|$2,699|\n|**Total**|**100.00%**|**$146,269**|**$95,100**|**53.81%**|**$51,170**|\n\nI\u2019m actually most obsessed with equities. Little bits of money that grow and pay you dividends. The worst thing that happens is they go down in price! Then you can buy more or use the income from the investments to buy more! So accessible, liquid, powerful. It has been third on my list of priorities as I gathered deposits and cashed in on Super deductions. Cashflow can get tight with my Super/Property strategy and I\u2019m not very liquid. So storing cash and extra savings in ETFs is my new drug! It really adds a lot of liquidity and accessible reserves to my portfolio. I burnt myself on some fun thematics like YOLO, ARKK and HCLN over the years. When I sold most of my assets to restructure my finances in 2022 I was down 24k on those. Sold out of my oil futures, single stocks as well (wish I\u2019d kept Palantir!). Went all in on an 80/20 VGS/VAS portfolio. Recently though I have been really excited about GHHF. It has a higher Oz content than I\u2019d like at 37% so I\u2019m continuing to buy VGS as well to keep me within my desired allocation. I haven\u2019t decided yet what ratio I want of leveraged ETFs but if I know myself, it will be as close to 100% as that mathematical asymptote will let me get lol. Leverage is just so sexy the way it juices returns! \u00a0\n\n# 3.9 My Crypto Investments\n\n**$104,036.11** | **14.73% of NW** | **BCH(69%)/BTC(18%)/ETH(13%)**\n\nI am a huge fan of transparent and immutable blockchain technology. It has a lot of applications. I\u2019m still waiting for the killer app, but it isn\u2019t BTC. I bought BTC in 2017 and also sold it in 2017 because it had gone up a lot and\u00a0transactions were congested and fees were so high it was unusable as peer to peer cash. I thought it would crash because it was useless; and still is with high fees and handicapped transaction volume. Big regrets tho lol.\n\nIf you know anything about crypto I didn\u2019t sell before the BCH hard fork at least. So I got all those coins for free! Which forked twice more for BSV and XEC. In 2022 during the great restructuring I sold the latter two hard forks for free money and also 12 shitcoins I had accumulated. I kept all my BCH and add to it regularly. For me it\u2019s the most useful crypto. You can send any amount instantly, peer to peer for less than a cent to anyone, anywhere in the world! The transaction is always confirmed in the next block for immutability. I love it. Couldn\u2019t resist DCAing back into BTC because damn that thing just keeps going up! I also invest in ETH. Crystallised $34k in gains from crypto over the years so Ive only got $24k of capital in my crypto portfolio.\n\nI think there\u2019s a place for crypto in anyone\u2019s portfolio but it has to be about a project you know and think has utility. My allocation is a little high at 14.73% relative to NW. Adding to my other assets will make my crypto allocation a smaller part of my NW over time. I don\u2019t expect the growth to be as explosive going forward so it should balance out soon. Aiming for 10% allocation of my NW.\n\n# 4.0\u00a0Future Plans and Goals\n\nHaving average expenses of <40kpa means I\u2019m not far from my FIRE number! However I expect my spend to increase significantly over the next decade. We will eventually start renting a \u201cdream home\u201d or purchase a PPOR, dial up the spend on travel/hobbies and charitable giving, and setup an awesome camping rig which will have significant ownership costs. I also love a bit of luxury so my FI number is likely much higher. I guess my minimum goal is around $1.5-1.9m which is 60-76kp on a 4% SWR. I still have another 2-3 years of building my property portfolio so will need to continue working full-time for servicing. Then I\u2019m feeling a CoastFI vibe while my assets compound for me. I will work a mandated 150 hours per year minimum to maintain my pharmacy registration and fluctuate my workload as I need. The question I\u2019m mulling over is what does that CoastFI job look like over the coming years?\n\nI could easily stay with this government job as it\u2019s been very relaxing and well paid with free accommodation. The rural site is not my gf\u2019s favourite place though so I probably can\u2019t stay for more than 18 months. Have been keeping an eye on other state health jobs for internal transfer. I could go back to locuming. I have a great network and there\u2019s still plenty of work on but my gf is definitely over it having traveled with me for 4 years! It\u2019s also a more difficult lending landscape for servicing. The other option is getting into a business partnership. Having met dozens of pharmacy owners over the years I have been offered 4 partnerships. Pharmacies usually return 10-15% on owners equity! You need to be a pharmacist to own a pharmacy so there\u2019s less competition to get in. It\u2019s also a protected industry from competitors and both sides of government are pro locally-owned community pharmacies compared to the corporate pharmacy business model you see in the US, for example. It\u2019s an enticing prospect. It would be a challenge and the pay off on the back end will be great into the future. I don\u2019t know if I have it in me though when I can get to where I\u2019m going on my current \u201ceasy\u201d path. Something to contemplate as I learn and grow as a person and an investor!\u00a0\n\n# 5.0 Resources\n\nIf you want a list of resources that I liked the most from my learning I share it regularly in subs.

          "selftext": "I once worked in a call centre position for a \"middle-man\" company that assisted in retaining monthly donors to some major charities (National Breast Cancer Foundation, McGrath Foundation, Seeing Eye Dogs, I forgot the rest but others were also major ones).\n\nAll we would do are 3 minute calls, after you signed up to support a foundation in a shopping centre, verifying your details and clarifying your commitment. At this point, we would be the \"empathetic salesman\" and adjust your donation amount incase you feel you over committed. But again, the goal is retainment.\n\nIn the fine print, that no one ever reads, it says that 97% of your donation for the first 2 years goes to our company and after those 2 years your money goes to the charity itself (I dont recall if that was 100% to the charity or not). Our company operated all across Australia and even started operating the front lines trying to get people signed up. The line they would have to say is, \"The X foundation really does benefit the most from donations of 2 years or more\" and then slap on a slogan at the end which is given to us by the foundation themself. We go by scripts for just about every question you have and the answers are all to entice you to stay donating your money.\n\nFinance wise, even the people who stand in a shopping mall asking you to do monthly donations may not even work directly for that foundation. You are allowed to ask if they get commission (they do), and how much of the money goes to the charity, but that doesn't mean people won't lie.\n\nMore of a moral finance thing than a tax purposes one here. I quite after a month. If you donate directly through their website, you skip all the outside dodgy-ness.",

I graduated a 4 year pharmacy degree in 2013 and interned for a year in 2014 at 22 years old. In 2017 I completed my MBA and also got a cash gift of $20k from my parents. Accrued $58k of HECS debt including $7,300 of indexation that took 10 years to pay off by 2024.\n\n# 1.1 Career Progression\n\nI worked in my home town for 3 years after graduation in a 9-5 before starting locum work in 2017 when my income took off. I was chasing the highest paid contracts in new locations I hadn\u2019t traveled to before. I would cover maternity/paternity contracts, owner/staff annual leave, busy holiday periods etc. This work coupled my thrill of making money with my desire to travel and see new places. I have worked in over 30 towns/cities in Australia and visited/camped in scores more in between contracts. Contracts could range from 2 weeks to 3 months.\n\nI love my job! I\u2019m a huge people person so being able to help people with their minor or major health care needs really makes me fulfilled! I have been very lucky to happen into a profession that I enjoy and has had really good wage growth.\u00a0\n\nIt was tough and stressful working as a contractor for 8 years under an ABN without annual/sick leave: sourcing contracts, negotiating contracts, syncing work calendars with social and personal commitments, living out of a cars and suitcases, driving thousands of kilometres to new jobs, difficult lending landscape, lumpy income, being away from friends and family etc. But the money was far better compared to working a regular pharmacy job. Being hourly I also maxed my workload while on contract so would routinely average 55 to 60 hours per week depending on the contract.\n\n# 1.2 Current Role\n\nIn 2025 my position is with a state government: $155k including 12.75% super. I received a $30k sign on bonus and will get a $20k retention bonus at 12 & 24 months. Accommodation is included as the location is a rural site. I work 38h Monday - Friday with an unpaid hour for lunch! The new work/life balance was great for 2 months. Then I started locuming on weekends because I\u2019m addicted to the hourly rate! Currently working 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on a Sunday for $110/h gross. So I\u2019m 52h/week across 7 days which is manageable but I (mostly my gf) would really like a day off. I\u2019m currently looking at dropping my two weekend shifts and negotiating a 14 hour shift on a Saturday at a new pharmacy for the $110/h rate! Same 52h but across 6 days. Perfect.\n\n# 2.0 Expenses and Savings Rate\n\n|Item|FY '22|FY '23|FY '24|FY '25|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Expenses**|**$38,906**|**$28,097**|**$35,143**|**$36,944**|\n|Debits|$7,391|$9,140|$3,556|$76|\n|Credit Card|$5,184|$9,207|$9,561|$19,631|\n|Joint A/c|$6,704|$9,750|$8,809|$6,481|\n|Int\u2019 Travel|$19,627|$0|$13,217|$10,756|\n||||||\n|**Post-tax SR**|**23.3%**|**77.8%**|**75.7%**|**76.3%**|\n\n# 2.1 Expenses in my 20s\n\nThrough uni (2010-2013) I worked casually at a pharmacy. Was paid quite a bit for an 18-21 year old pharmacy student so was pretty happy! Never really saved anything or invested at this stage. Lucky to live at home through my uni degree rent free. Spent all my cash buying 3 progressively more expensive second hand cars over 5 years which all needed hella repairs. Spent the rest of my money on house hold goods, food, booze, partying, drugs, domestic travel, dating, fashion, whatever. When I started working my pharmacy internship in 2014 I was paying $150/w in rent to my parents. This continued until I moved out in 2016 and had a mortgage with adult bills. Wasn\u2019t much left over after budgeting for bills and mortgage. You can see my income that year took a big dip! Was paid far more as a student than an intern!\n\n# 2.2 Adult Expenses\n\n2017 you can see my income increased a lot when I started locum work. So of course I dialled up the spend! I\u2019d converted my PPOR to an IP as I left my home town to start work on the road. So from 2017 until January 2025 I have never paid rent or a PPOR mortgage repayment. I negotiated contracts with employers to cover accommodation and usually travel costs. Sometimes it was caravan parks or motels, sometimes AirBnBs, the owner\u2019s homes or hotels. In between contracts we camp, stay with friends/family, overseas travel or book domestic accommodation. Currently I split $250/w with my gf for a room in a city I travel to for work on weekends. Having very little housing costs obviously has kept my living expenses extremely low. Not feasible forever but great to help me increase my savings rate and get a head start on investing.\n\nFortunate to have met my partner traveling in 2019 who was also on board with FI! This year she is now CoastFI on her overseas assets. We share all our living and travel expenses through a joint bank account we contribute to equally. I apportion the property portfolio equity, debt and cashflow 50/50 with her in our individual NW numbers. We have and will continue to use a mix of our cash for deposits and expenses. In the event of a breakup we will split the property assets 50/50 after paying out our individual contributions and cash in the offsets. All our other assets are separate.\n\n# 2.3 Savings Rate\n\nI keep spending pretty tight these days but I LOVE paying for convenience. I love not having to be stressed about the price of catching an Uber/Taxi, price of groceries, or buying/replacing something that I want when I need it. I don\u2019t bother tracking my spending too closely. I do have a budget that I update every year with my big known expenses and guestimates for fuel, food and discretionary spending etc but I don\u2019t reconcile it. The budgeted expenses come out pretty close to my top line spend in my Expenses/SR table so I don\u2019t feel the need to get more granular. The only thing I itemise further is international travel because that\u2019s a big part of my FI life! Savings rate has been >70% since I\u2019ve been living life thru the FI lens so I CBFd scrutinising my expenses any further.\n\n# 2.4 Lifestyle Creep\n\nI do love dropping a bomb on holidays though! 2018/19 spent $20.2k in SE Asia for 9 months meeting my gf at the end of it. 2022 I spent $19.6k on 4 months across 8 US states and Brazil. 2024 I spent $13.2k on 10 weeks in South America. 2025 I spent $10.7k on 4 weeks in the US.\u00a0\n\nAlready we've inflated our travel lifestyle by booking Airbnbs/hotels in our desired areas instead of hostels in a cheaper location. We book flights with convenient departure/arrival times even if they're more expensive. We have a spend-like-we\u2019re-rich rule on holiday to help us really enjoy ourselves. I'd love to be in a position to travel more often, upgrade to business class for flights >5 hours, dial up the luxury a lil in the accommodation we book, travel to more expensive locations, hire a private driver/tour guide, ball out on experiences in incredible locations etc. The lifestyle creep will come easy so I need to grow my NW to support the spend I want to have.\n\n# 3.0 Investing\n\n# Net Worth Summary\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Net Worth**|**$251,919**|**$390,401**|**$473,245**|**$708,486**|\n|$ increase||$138,482|$82,845|$229,240|\n|% increase||54.97%|21.22%|48.44%|\n\n# Assets\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Super|$58,227|$97,909|$134,719|$213,047|\n|Equities|$65,517|$59,176|$78,007|$146,269|\n|Property|$217,000|$206,000|$470,000|$762,500|\n|Crypto|$31,754|$56,260|$79,649|$104,036|\n|Cash|$29,607|$122,965|$88,600|$47,722|\n|Car|$9,125|$9,125|$8,000|$6,000|\n|**Total**|**$411,229**|**$551,435**|**$858,976**|**$1,273,574**|\n\n# Debt\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mortgage|$158,500|$154,995|$382,766|$567,200|\n|Credit Card|$810|$6,039|$2,964|$3,888|\n|**Total**|**$159,310**|**$161,034**|**$385,730**|**$571,088**|\n\nn.b.

From 2017 I had been \u2018investing\u2019 in assets with no real plan: penny stocks, single stocks, oil futures, crypto and some thematic ETFs. Clearly had employed zero education and strategy on how to invest in any asset class.\u00a0Had some winners and losers but ended up with a modest CGT bill. The gain pales in comparison to the returns I would have received by buying another IP or investing in my Super and ETFs since 2017 instead.\n\n# 3.2 Getting Educated\n\nIn 2022 I came back from another big, expensive, overseas holiday. I had spent all my cash and a my mix of random assets were in decline. I was again canvasing for some lucrative contracts to fill up the bank account. I knew I had to be more intentional with my money if I wanted to continue this lifestyle of travel and part-time work. I was getting into podcasts at this time and had been writing down a few book titles about investing, personal finance and self-help. So I dove into that!\n\nAfter my learning and finding r/FIAustralia and some other Subreddits I had discovered the 4% guideline and NW calculations. I was surprised to find that my NW was a touch over $250k, albeit spread across a bunch of random asset classes. Seeing that number at 29 years old was really motivating. I knew I could accelerate this journey by earning more. You can see from earnings FY23-FY25 my income increased a lot. I took less holidays but my hourly rate as a locum had also kept increasing. During downtime at work and after hours I spent an obscene amount of time devouring podcasts, books, articles, paid courses, webinars, websites, YT videos, Instagram reels, TikToks and Reddit learning as much as I could about investing, personal finance and property. I sold almost all my random mix of assets back to cash then I came up with my plan:\u00a0Super, property, ETFs, crypto. In that order.\n\n# 3.3 Super Philosophy\n\nI love Super. There is no better tax advantaged way to invest your money for building wealth. Yes Super is locked away until retirement age but that\u2019s the whole point of investing: allowing time to compound your capital by reinvesting the dividends while you add to the pile. By contributing to Super early you are allowing those extra tax dollars saved and contributed capital the longest time possible to compound, tax free!! If something catastrophic happens where I can no longer work and all my money is \u201clocked up\u201d in Super there are early access schemes, income protection, TPD insurance, government welfare programs, other assets, family and friends etc. There are myriad options to support you in the worst-case scenario instead of ignoring Super.\n\nYou really need to take care of yourself for when you\u2019re elderly and too broken to keep working. You do this by jacking your Super to the tits ASAP and then you can start bringing your retirement age back by investing outside of Super.\u00a0If you can\u2019t afford to top your Super up to the current $30k limit after your employer Super Guarantee (SG) you\u2019re probably not earning enough to retire that early anyway. Which means you should definitely prioritise Super. I love [this article](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/how-much-to-save-inside-vs-outside-super/#stages) from\u00a0[PassiveInvestingAustralia.com](http://PassiveInvestingAustralia.com)\u00a0showing how prioritising your Super as an investment will actually help you retire sooner as a low income earner. If you are a high earner you can afford to top up to $30k. You should definitely prioritise Super for the 15% (and 30% DIV293) tax rate which will be miles better than your marginal tax rates. \u00a0\n\n# 3.4 My Super Investment\n\n**$213,046.51** | **31.15% of NW**\n\nHaving the SG since I started working as a casual pharmacy student in 2011 meant I had a good head start on my balance. In 2020 I took out the COVID relief $20k. In hindsight I should have left it in there of course. Especially considering I left it in cash for over 6 months, missing the big V shaped recovery and new all time highs! Oops. In FY23 my income had increased a lot and I was looking for tax deductions. Checking MyGov, I had $90k of unused concessional contributions! I am spreading those tax deductions over 3-4 years to use them up consecutively before they expire after 5 years. I use concessional contributions and salary sacrificing to max my yearly cap and fill up previous unused caps.\n\nThrough my income and investment income in the future I always see myself maxing my contribution limit to Super. I may over invest in Super but I\u2019m not looking to retire ASAP and I plan to give a lot of my wealth away before I die. Investing in Super will give me a huge pot that could help a lot of people! I also plan on maintaining my pharmacy registration over the coming decades. I am required to work an annual 150 hours minimum. Perpetually CoastFI!\n\nI hate that DIV296 tax applies to unrealised gains. I don\u2019t mind taxing Super more above $3m on realised gains though. No one needs that much in Super. Based on my projections I will be close to that balance in 27 years at a traditional retirement age.\n\n# 3.5 Property Philosophy\n\nTalk about a tax deduction: if I love Super, then I\u2019m HORNY FOR PROPERTY! I actually don\u2019t love negative gearing though. Losing money to save your marginal tax rate is an absurd strategy but that's what we're stuck with in Australia. Can\u2019t wait to get my portfolio to neutral territory. I do love to claim the non-cash expenses like depreciation though! Leveraging to buy property is the best way to compound your capital IMO. You have way more control over your assets, can manufacture equity and directly increase the yields. You don\u2019t have that level of finesse over companies in the share market (unless you\u2019re getting a board seat lol). The massive low-cost leverage you can apply to your capital by investing in property makes it a superior investment option to build wealth compared to the light leverage you can get with equities. I think debt recycling is a really sexy strategy too and I can\u2019t wait to utilise that when we buy a home!\n\nThe reason property was second on my list of priorities over ETFs is two-fold, though related. Firstly, with leverage you can control a large dollar value of assets in the market. You want to benefit from the maximum amount of assets growing in the market for the most time possible. Secondly: government mandated inflation at 2-3% erodes the value of the debt. So you need to take on the debt and buy the assets ASAP to allow positive compounding on the largest amount of assets and negative compounding on your debt through inflation! This move was all about time. Maximising the time you control these huge assets with maximum leverage will compound better returns.\n\n# 3.6 My Property Investment\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|IPs|2.5|\n|Total Value|$1,525,000|\n|Total Debt|$1,134,400|\n|Net Value|$390,600|\n|Leverage Ratio|74%|\n|Offset Account|$47,722|\n|**Net Value**|**$438,322**|\n\n# Profit / Loss Statement\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Income|$74,620|\n|Total Expenses|$104,781|\n|Offset Gain Back|$2,983|\n|**Estimated Cashflow before tax**|**\u2013$27,178**|\n|Depreciation|$17,128|\n|Accountant Expense|$2,500|\n|Land Tax|$0|\n|Tax Rate %|39%|\n|**Estimated Cashflow after tax**|**\u2013$11,424**|\n\n# Blended Interest Rate                                                       6.25%\n\n**Equity share of $195 300 is 27.65% of NW.**\n\nIn 2016 I grossly overpaid on a house and land package in a Townsville suburb with lots of developable land AND in a flood zone! I\u2019m very nervous every wet season in NQld. But it didn\u2019t flood in 2019 (just) or during this year\u2019s flood event in March.\u00a0I knew nothing about investing in property evidenced in the fact that I was negative equity until it finally grew enough 8 years later to negate the premium I paid the developer and builder. I built this house with my then gf and still own it 50/50 as tenants in common. I put in $23k cash, she $13k, and we were $405k all in. Current valuation 600k so a pretty poor effort over 8.5 years especially as the growth only came the last 18 months. It is a 7%+ gross yield on purchase now so it has been positively geared last two FYs at least. I plan to add a 4th bedroom by enclosing a 2nd living area to add an estimated 80-90k of equity based on comparables in the suburb and selling it in 2026. I will unlock the equity as cash, get the borrowing capacity back and dissolve the complex loan product I hold over the property with my ex. I need to check with my accountant but I think I can claim the 6 year rule on partial gains up to 2022 as I haven\u2019t claimed another PPOR. I didn\u2019t get it valued at the 6 year mark though so this might prove difficult if it\u2019s even possible!\n\nSecond property was also purchased in Townsville. May \u201824, 10% down at 450k with 5.4% gross yield, cash deposit. Bank valuation this June: 575k!! Third property in Mackay. Purchased September \u201824, 10% down at 570k with 5.02% gross yield cash and equity from property #1. Bank valuation this June: $650k!! So there\u2019s almost 400k of equity in the portfolio ATM. As a pharmacist I can get 90% LVR lend no LMI without being punished on the rates. It\u2019s a great lending product and very happy to be able to take advantage! I am pre-approved for 600k more in my personal name with this loan product. I plan to use this to buy in one of three locations: Lavington, Albury; South Grafton, NSW or Bendigo, VIC. Suburb medians are 500-570k and growing with demand and supply side data metrics looking promising while gross yields of 5%+ are achievable.\n\n# 3.7 Future Property Plans\n\nI\u2019m close to my Qld land tax threshold in my personal name and want to diversify states. WA and SA have had a lot of growth and Victoria has a few investors head winds: They have a low land tax threshold (50k!) and have hostile landlord policies. There\u2019s lots of developable land down that way so will have less of a supply constraint long term compared to other markets.\u00a0There\u2019s still potential for growth but I think there\u2019s better opportunities in NSW and Qld.\n\nGoing forward I will need to utilise trust structures to preserve my borrowing capacity. Broker says I\u2019ll be tapped out with the majors after #4 but I will still be able to lend with 2nd and 3rd tier lenders, especially if I let go of property #1. My 5th purchase is going to be a commercial property. I will then pigeon pair that inside the same trust with another growth property. This will help me pay off the debt of the commercial property in the future while keeping the trust positive through this holding period. The banks can disregard the debt inside that trust if it\u2019s positive cash flow and I can lend again based on my personal capacity. Strategy has been fleshed out with my broker and tax agent. It\u2019s risky obviously but damn I just love leverage.\n\nI don\u2019t have a goal for portfolio size, equity position or cashflow, but looking at growth on a $4.5m assets base in a [Future Value calculator](https://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html?cyearsv=30&cstartingprinciplev=4%2C500%2C000&cinterestratev=5&ccontributeamountv=0&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=Calculate#calresult) looks pretty good to me! Achievable too once I move into commercial property assets where I will be buying in higher price points.\n\n# 3.8 My ETF Investments\n\n**20.71% of NW**\n\n|Ticker|Allocation|Value|Contributions|%ROI|$ROI|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|VGS|61.24%|$89,570|$52,930|69.22%|$36,640|\n|VAS|21.96%|$32,121|$20,291|58.30%|$11,830|\n|GHFF|16.80%|$24,578|$21,879|12.34%|$2,699|\n|**Total**|**100.00%**|**$146,269**|**$95,100**|**53.81%**|**$51,170**|\n\nI\u2019m actually most obsessed with equities. Little bits of money that grow and pay you dividends. The worst thing that happens is they go down in price! Then you can buy more or use the income from the investments to buy more! So accessible, liquid, powerful. It has been third on my list of priorities as I gathered deposits and cashed in on Super deductions. Cashflow can get tight with my Super/Property strategy and I\u2019m not very liquid. So storing cash and extra savings in ETFs is my new drug! It really adds a lot of liquidity and accessible reserves to my portfolio. I burnt myself on some fun thematics like YOLO, ARKK and HCLN over the years. When I sold most of my assets to restructure my finances in 2022 I was down 24k on those. Sold out of my oil futures, single stocks as well (wish I\u2019d kept Palantir!). Went all in on an 80/20 VGS/VAS portfolio. Recently though I have been really excited about GHHF. It has a higher Oz content than I\u2019d like at 37% so I\u2019m continuing to buy VGS as well to keep me within my desired allocation. I haven\u2019t decided yet what ratio I want of leveraged ETFs but if I know myself, it will be as close to 100% as that mathematical asymptote will let me get lol. Leverage is just so sexy the way it juices returns! \u00a0\n\n# 3.9 My Crypto Investments\n\n**$104,036.11** | **14.73% of NW** | **BCH(69%)/BTC(18%)/ETH(13%)**\n\nI am a huge fan of transparent and immutable blockchain technology. It has a lot of applications. I\u2019m still waiting for the killer app, but it isn\u2019t BTC. I bought BTC in 2017 and also sold it in 2017 because it had gone up a lot and\u00a0transactions were congested and fees were so high it was unusable as peer to peer cash. I thought it would crash because it was useless; and still is with high fees and handicapped transaction volume. Big regrets tho lol.\n\nIf you know anything about crypto I didn\u2019t sell before the BCH hard fork at least. So I got all those coins for free! Which forked twice more for BSV and XEC. In 2022 during the great restructuring I sold the latter two hard forks for free money and also 12 shitcoins I had accumulated. I kept all my BCH and add to it regularly. For me it\u2019s the most useful crypto. You can send any amount instantly, peer to peer for less than a cent to anyone, anywhere in the world! The transaction is always confirmed in the next block for immutability. I love it. Couldn\u2019t resist DCAing back into BTC because damn that thing just keeps going up! I also invest in ETH. Crystallised $34k in gains from crypto over the years so Ive only got $24k of capital in my crypto portfolio.\n\nI think there\u2019s a place for crypto in anyone\u2019s portfolio but it has to be about a project you know and think has utility. My allocation is a little high at 14.73% relative to NW. Adding to my other assets will make my crypto allocation a smaller part of my NW over time. I don\u2019t expect the growth to be as explosive going forward so it should balance out soon. Aiming for 10% allocation of my NW.\n\n# 4.0\u00a0Future Plans and Goals\n\nHaving average expenses of <40kpa means I\u2019m not far from my FIRE number! However I expect my spend to increase significantly over the next decade. We will eventually start renting a \u201cdream home\u201d or purchase a PPOR, dial up the spend on travel/hobbies and charitable giving, and setup an awesome camping rig which will have significant ownership costs. I also love a bit of luxury so my FI number is likely much higher. I guess my minimum goal is around $1.5-1.9m which is 60-76kp on a 4% SWR. I still have another 2-3 years of building my property portfolio so will need to continue working full-time for servicing. Then I\u2019m feeling a CoastFI vibe while my assets compound for me. I will work a mandated 150 hours per year minimum to maintain my pharmacy registration and fluctuate my workload as I need. The question I\u2019m mulling over is what does that CoastFI job look like over the coming years?\n\nI could easily stay with this government job as it\u2019s been very relaxing and well paid with free accommodation. The rural site is not my gf\u2019s favourite place though so I probably can\u2019t stay for more than 18 months. Have been keeping an eye on other state health jobs for internal transfer. I could go back to locuming. I have a great network and there\u2019s still plenty of work on but my gf is definitely over it having traveled with me for 4 years! It\u2019s also a more difficult lending landscape for servicing. The other option is getting into a business partnership. Having met dozens of pharmacy owners over the years I have been offered 4 partnerships. Pharmacies usually return 10-15% on owners equity! You need to be a pharmacist to own a pharmacy so there\u2019s less competition to get in. It\u2019s also a protected industry from competitors and both sides of government are pro locally-owned community pharmacies compared to the corporate pharmacy business model you see in the US, for example. It\u2019s an enticing prospect. It would be a challenge and the pay off on the back end will be great into the future. I don\u2019t know if I have it in me though when I can get to where I\u2019m going on my current \u201ceasy\u201d path. Something to contemplate as I learn and grow as a person and an investor!\u00a0\n\n# 5.0 Resources\n\nIf you want a list of resources that I liked the most from my learning I share it regularly in subs.

          "selftext": "I once worked in a call centre position for a \"middle-man\" company that assisted in retaining monthly donors to some major charities (National Breast Cancer Foundation, McGrath Foundation, Seeing Eye Dogs, I forgot the rest but others were also major ones).\n\nAll we would do are 3 minute calls, after you signed up to support a foundation in a shopping centre, verifying your details and clarifying your commitment. At this point, we would be the \"empathetic salesman\" and adjust your donation amount incase you feel you over committed. But again, the goal is retainment.\n\nIn the fine print, that no one ever reads, it says that 97% of your donation for the first 2 years goes to our company and after those 2 years your money goes to the charity itself (I dont recall if that was 100% to the charity or not). Our company operated all across Australia and even started operating the front lines trying to get people signed up. The line they would have to say is, \"The X foundation really does benefit the most from donations of 2 years or more\" and then slap on a slogan at the end which is given to us by the foundation themself. We go by scripts for just about every question you have and the answers are all to entice you to stay donating your money.\n\nFinance wise, even the people who stand in a shopping mall asking you to do monthly donations may not even work directly for that foundation. You are allowed to ask if they get commission (they do), and how much of the money goes to the charity, but that doesn't mean people won't lie.\n\nMore of a moral finance thing than a tax purposes one here. I quite after a month. If you donate directly through their website, you skip all the outside dodgy-ness.",

I graduated a 4 year pharmacy degree in 2013 and interned for a year in 2014 at 22 years old. In 2017 I completed my MBA and also got a cash gift of $20k from my parents. Accrued $58k of HECS debt including $7,300 of indexation that took 10 years to pay off by 2024.\n\n# 1.1 Career Progression\n\nI worked in my home town for 3 years after graduation in a 9-5 before starting locum work in 2017 when my income took off. I was chasing the highest paid contracts in new locations I hadn\u2019t traveled to before. I would cover maternity/paternity contracts, owner/staff annual leave, busy holiday periods etc. This work coupled my thrill of making money with my desire to travel and see new places. I have worked in over 30 towns/cities in Australia and visited/camped in scores more in between contracts. Contracts could range from 2 weeks to 3 months.\n\nI love my job! I\u2019m a huge people person so being able to help people with their minor or major health care needs really makes me fulfilled! I have been very lucky to happen into a profession that I enjoy and has had really good wage growth.\u00a0\n\nIt was tough and stressful working as a contractor for 8 years under an ABN without annual/sick leave: sourcing contracts, negotiating contracts, syncing work calendars with social and personal commitments, living out of a cars and suitcases, driving thousands of kilometres to new jobs, difficult lending landscape, lumpy income, being away from friends and family etc. But the money was far better compared to working a regular pharmacy job. Being hourly I also maxed my workload while on contract so would routinely average 55 to 60 hours per week depending on the contract.\n\n# 1.2 Current Role\n\nIn 2025 my position is with a state government: $155k including 12.75% super. I received a $30k sign on bonus and will get a $20k retention bonus at 12 & 24 months. Accommodation is included as the location is a rural site. I work 38h Monday - Friday with an unpaid hour for lunch! The new work/life balance was great for 2 months. Then I started locuming on weekends because I\u2019m addicted to the hourly rate! Currently working 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on a Sunday for $110/h gross. So I\u2019m 52h/week across 7 days which is manageable but I (mostly my gf) would really like a day off. I\u2019m currently looking at dropping my two weekend shifts and negotiating a 14 hour shift on a Saturday at a new pharmacy for the $110/h rate! Same 52h but across 6 days. Perfect.\n\n# 2.0 Expenses and Savings Rate\n\n|Item|FY '22|FY '23|FY '24|FY '25|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Expenses**|**$38,906**|**$28,097**|**$35,143**|**$36,944**|\n|Debits|$7,391|$9,140|$3,556|$76|\n|Credit Card|$5,184|$9,207|$9,561|$19,631|\n|Joint A/c|$6,704|$9,750|$8,809|$6,481|\n|Int\u2019 Travel|$19,627|$0|$13,217|$10,756|\n||||||\n|**Post-tax SR**|**23.3%**|**77.8%**|**75.7%**|**76.3%**|\n\n# 2.1 Expenses in my 20s\n\nThrough uni (2010-2013) I worked casually at a pharmacy. Was paid quite a bit for an 18-21 year old pharmacy student so was pretty happy! Never really saved anything or invested at this stage. Lucky to live at home through my uni degree rent free. Spent all my cash buying 3 progressively more expensive second hand cars over 5 years which all needed hella repairs. Spent the rest of my money on house hold goods, food, booze, partying, drugs, domestic travel, dating, fashion, whatever. When I started working my pharmacy internship in 2014 I was paying $150/w in rent to my parents. This continued until I moved out in 2016 and had a mortgage with adult bills. Wasn\u2019t much left over after budgeting for bills and mortgage. You can see my income that year took a big dip! Was paid far more as a student than an intern!\n\n# 2.2 Adult Expenses\n\n2017 you can see my income increased a lot when I started locum work. So of course I dialled up the spend! I\u2019d converted my PPOR to an IP as I left my home town to start work on the road. So from 2017 until January 2025 I have never paid rent or a PPOR mortgage repayment. I negotiated contracts with employers to cover accommodation and usually travel costs. Sometimes it was caravan parks or motels, sometimes AirBnBs, the owner\u2019s homes or hotels. In between contracts we camp, stay with friends/family, overseas travel or book domestic accommodation. Currently I split $250/w with my gf for a room in a city I travel to for work on weekends. Having very little housing costs obviously has kept my living expenses extremely low. Not feasible forever but great to help me increase my savings rate and get a head start on investing.\n\nFortunate to have met my partner traveling in 2019 who was also on board with FI! This year she is now CoastFI on her overseas assets. We share all our living and travel expenses through a joint bank account we contribute to equally. I apportion the property portfolio equity, debt and cashflow 50/50 with her in our individual NW numbers. We have and will continue to use a mix of our cash for deposits and expenses. In the event of a breakup we will split the property assets 50/50 after paying out our individual contributions and cash in the offsets. All our other assets are separate.\n\n# 2.3 Savings Rate\n\nI keep spending pretty tight these days but I LOVE paying for convenience. I love not having to be stressed about the price of catching an Uber/Taxi, price of groceries, or buying/replacing something that I want when I need it. I don\u2019t bother tracking my spending too closely. I do have a budget that I update every year with my big known expenses and guestimates for fuel, food and discretionary spending etc but I don\u2019t reconcile it. The budgeted expenses come out pretty close to my top line spend in my Expenses/SR table so I don\u2019t feel the need to get more granular. The only thing I itemise further is international travel because that\u2019s a big part of my FI life! Savings rate has been >70% since I\u2019ve been living life thru the FI lens so I CBFd scrutinising my expenses any further.\n\n# 2.4 Lifestyle Creep\n\nI do love dropping a bomb on holidays though! 2018/19 spent $20.2k in SE Asia for 9 months meeting my gf at the end of it. 2022 I spent $19.6k on 4 months across 8 US states and Brazil. 2024 I spent $13.2k on 10 weeks in South America. 2025 I spent $10.7k on 4 weeks in the US.\u00a0\n\nAlready we've inflated our travel lifestyle by booking Airbnbs/hotels in our desired areas instead of hostels in a cheaper location. We book flights with convenient departure/arrival times even if they're more expensive. We have a spend-like-we\u2019re-rich rule on holiday to help us really enjoy ourselves. I'd love to be in a position to travel more often, upgrade to business class for flights >5 hours, dial up the luxury a lil in the accommodation we book, travel to more expensive locations, hire a private driver/tour guide, ball out on experiences in incredible locations etc. The lifestyle creep will come easy so I need to grow my NW to support the spend I want to have.\n\n# 3.0 Investing\n\n# Net Worth Summary\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Net Worth**|**$251,919**|**$390,401**|**$473,245**|**$708,486**|\n|$ increase||$138,482|$82,845|$229,240|\n|% increase||54.97%|21.22%|48.44%|\n\n# Assets\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Super|$58,227|$97,909|$134,719|$213,047|\n|Equities|$65,517|$59,176|$78,007|$146,269|\n|Property|$217,000|$206,000|$470,000|$762,500|\n|Crypto|$31,754|$56,260|$79,649|$104,036|\n|Cash|$29,607|$122,965|$88,600|$47,722|\n|Car|$9,125|$9,125|$8,000|$6,000|\n|**Total**|**$411,229**|**$551,435**|**$858,976**|**$1,273,574**|\n\n# Debt\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mortgage|$158,500|$154,995|$382,766|$567,200|\n|Credit Card|$810|$6,039|$2,964|$3,888|\n|**Total**|**$159,310**|**$161,034**|**$385,730**|**$571,088**|\n\nn.b.

From 2017 I had been \u2018investing\u2019 in assets with no real plan: penny stocks, single stocks, oil futures, crypto and some thematic ETFs. Clearly had employed zero education and strategy on how to invest in any asset class.\u00a0Had some winners and losers but ended up with a modest CGT bill. The gain pales in comparison to the returns I would have received by buying another IP or investing in my Super and ETFs since 2017 instead.\n\n# 3.2 Getting Educated\n\nIn 2022 I came back from another big, expensive, overseas holiday. I had spent all my cash and a my mix of random assets were in decline. I was again canvasing for some lucrative contracts to fill up the bank account. I knew I had to be more intentional with my money if I wanted to continue this lifestyle of travel and part-time work. I was getting into podcasts at this time and had been writing down a few book titles about investing, personal finance and self-help. So I dove into that!\n\nAfter my learning and finding r/FIAustralia and some other Subreddits I had discovered the 4% guideline and NW calculations. I was surprised to find that my NW was a touch over $250k, albeit spread across a bunch of random asset classes. Seeing that number at 29 years old was really motivating. I knew I could accelerate this journey by earning more. You can see from earnings FY23-FY25 my income increased a lot. I took less holidays but my hourly rate as a locum had also kept increasing. During downtime at work and after hours I spent an obscene amount of time devouring podcasts, books, articles, paid courses, webinars, websites, YT videos, Instagram reels, TikToks and Reddit learning as much as I could about investing, personal finance and property. I sold almost all my random mix of assets back to cash then I came up with my plan:\u00a0Super, property, ETFs, crypto. In that order.\n\n# 3.3 Super Philosophy\n\nI love Super. There is no better tax advantaged way to invest your money for building wealth. Yes Super is locked away until retirement age but that\u2019s the whole point of investing: allowing time to compound your capital by reinvesting the dividends while you add to the pile. By contributing to Super early you are allowing those extra tax dollars saved and contributed capital the longest time possible to compound, tax free!! If something catastrophic happens where I can no longer work and all my money is \u201clocked up\u201d in Super there are early access schemes, income protection, TPD insurance, government welfare programs, other assets, family and friends etc. There are myriad options to support you in the worst-case scenario instead of ignoring Super.\n\nYou really need to take care of yourself for when you\u2019re elderly and too broken to keep working. You do this by jacking your Super to the tits ASAP and then you can start bringing your retirement age back by investing outside of Super.\u00a0If you can\u2019t afford to top your Super up to the current $30k limit after your employer Super Guarantee (SG) you\u2019re probably not earning enough to retire that early anyway. Which means you should definitely prioritise Super. I love [this article](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/how-much-to-save-inside-vs-outside-super/#stages) from\u00a0[PassiveInvestingAustralia.com](http://PassiveInvestingAustralia.com)\u00a0showing how prioritising your Super as an investment will actually help you retire sooner as a low income earner. If you are a high earner you can afford to top up to $30k. You should definitely prioritise Super for the 15% (and 30% DIV293) tax rate which will be miles better than your marginal tax rates. \u00a0\n\n# 3.4 My Super Investment\n\n**$213,046.51** | **31.15% of NW**\n\nHaving the SG since I started working as a casual pharmacy student in 2011 meant I had a good head start on my balance. In 2020 I took out the COVID relief $20k. In hindsight I should have left it in there of course. Especially considering I left it in cash for over 6 months, missing the big V shaped recovery and new all time highs! Oops. In FY23 my income had increased a lot and I was looking for tax deductions. Checking MyGov, I had $90k of unused concessional contributions! I am spreading those tax deductions over 3-4 years to use them up consecutively before they expire after 5 years. I use concessional contributions and salary sacrificing to max my yearly cap and fill up previous unused caps.\n\nThrough my income and investment income in the future I always see myself maxing my contribution limit to Super. I may over invest in Super but I\u2019m not looking to retire ASAP and I plan to give a lot of my wealth away before I die. Investing in Super will give me a huge pot that could help a lot of people! I also plan on maintaining my pharmacy registration over the coming decades. I am required to work an annual 150 hours minimum. Perpetually CoastFI!\n\nI hate that DIV296 tax applies to unrealised gains. I don\u2019t mind taxing Super more above $3m on realised gains though. No one needs that much in Super. Based on my projections I will be close to that balance in 27 years at a traditional retirement age.\n\n# 3.5 Property Philosophy\n\nTalk about a tax deduction: if I love Super, then I\u2019m HORNY FOR PROPERTY! I actually don\u2019t love negative gearing though. Losing money to save your marginal tax rate is an absurd strategy but that's what we're stuck with in Australia. Can\u2019t wait to get my portfolio to neutral territory. I do love to claim the non-cash expenses like depreciation though! Leveraging to buy property is the best way to compound your capital IMO. You have way more control over your assets, can manufacture equity and directly increase the yields. You don\u2019t have that level of finesse over companies in the share market (unless you\u2019re getting a board seat lol). The massive low-cost leverage you can apply to your capital by investing in property makes it a superior investment option to build wealth compared to the light leverage you can get with equities. I think debt recycling is a really sexy strategy too and I can\u2019t wait to utilise that when we buy a home!\n\nThe reason property was second on my list of priorities over ETFs is two-fold, though related. Firstly, with leverage you can control a large dollar value of assets in the market. You want to benefit from the maximum amount of assets growing in the market for the most time possible. Secondly: government mandated inflation at 2-3% erodes the value of the debt. So you need to take on the debt and buy the assets ASAP to allow positive compounding on the largest amount of assets and negative compounding on your debt through inflation! This move was all about time. Maximising the time you control these huge assets with maximum leverage will compound better returns.\n\n# 3.6 My Property Investment\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|IPs|2.5|\n|Total Value|$1,525,000|\n|Total Debt|$1,134,400|\n|Net Value|$390,600|\n|Leverage Ratio|74%|\n|Offset Account|$47,722|\n|**Net Value**|**$438,322**|\n\n# Profit / Loss Statement\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Income|$74,620|\n|Total Expenses|$104,781|\n|Offset Gain Back|$2,983|\n|**Estimated Cashflow before tax**|**\u2013$27,178**|\n|Depreciation|$17,128|\n|Accountant Expense|$2,500|\n|Land Tax|$0|\n|Tax Rate %|39%|\n|**Estimated Cashflow after tax**|**\u2013$11,424**|\n\n# Blended Interest Rate                                                       6.25%\n\n**Equity share of $195 300 is 27.65% of NW.**\n\nIn 2016 I grossly overpaid on a house and land package in a Townsville suburb with lots of developable land AND in a flood zone! I\u2019m very nervous every wet season in NQld. But it didn\u2019t flood in 2019 (just) or during this year\u2019s flood event in March.\u00a0I knew nothing about investing in property evidenced in the fact that I was negative equity until it finally grew enough 8 years later to negate the premium I paid the developer and builder. I built this house with my then gf and still own it 50/50 as tenants in common. I put in $23k cash, she $13k, and we were $405k all in. Current valuation 600k so a pretty poor effort over 8.5 years especially as the growth only came the last 18 months. It is a 7%+ gross yield on purchase now so it has been positively geared last two FYs at least. I plan to add a 4th bedroom by enclosing a 2nd living area to add an estimated 80-90k of equity based on comparables in the suburb and selling it in 2026. I will unlock the equity as cash, get the borrowing capacity back and dissolve the complex loan product I hold over the property with my ex. I need to check with my accountant but I think I can claim the 6 year rule on partial gains up to 2022 as I haven\u2019t claimed another PPOR. I didn\u2019t get it valued at the 6 year mark though so this might prove difficult if it\u2019s even possible!\n\nSecond property was also purchased in Townsville. May \u201824, 10% down at 450k with 5.4% gross yield, cash deposit. Bank valuation this June: 575k!! Third property in Mackay. Purchased September \u201824, 10% down at 570k with 5.02% gross yield cash and equity from property #1. Bank valuation this June: $650k!! So there\u2019s almost 400k of equity in the portfolio ATM. As a pharmacist I can get 90% LVR lend no LMI without being punished on the rates. It\u2019s a great lending product and very happy to be able to take advantage! I am pre-approved for 600k more in my personal name with this loan product. I plan to use this to buy in one of three locations: Lavington, Albury; South Grafton, NSW or Bendigo, VIC. Suburb medians are 500-570k and growing with demand and supply side data metrics looking promising while gross yields of 5%+ are achievable.\n\n# 3.7 Future Property Plans\n\nI\u2019m close to my Qld land tax threshold in my personal name and want to diversify states. WA and SA have had a lot of growth and Victoria has a few investors head winds: They have a low land tax threshold (50k!) and have hostile landlord policies. There\u2019s lots of developable land down that way so will have less of a supply constraint long term compared to other markets.\u00a0There\u2019s still potential for growth but I think there\u2019s better opportunities in NSW and Qld.\n\nGoing forward I will need to utilise trust structures to preserve my borrowing capacity. Broker says I\u2019ll be tapped out with the majors after #4 but I will still be able to lend with 2nd and 3rd tier lenders, especially if I let go of property #1. My 5th purchase is going to be a commercial property. I will then pigeon pair that inside the same trust with another growth property. This will help me pay off the debt of the commercial property in the future while keeping the trust positive through this holding period. The banks can disregard the debt inside that trust if it\u2019s positive cash flow and I can lend again based on my personal capacity. Strategy has been fleshed out with my broker and tax agent. It\u2019s risky obviously but damn I just love leverage.\n\nI don\u2019t have a goal for portfolio size, equity position or cashflow, but looking at growth on a $4.5m assets base in a [Future Value calculator](https://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html?cyearsv=30&cstartingprinciplev=4%2C500%2C000&cinterestratev=5&ccontributeamountv=0&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=Calculate#calresult) looks pretty good to me! Achievable too once I move into commercial property assets where I will be buying in higher price points.\n\n# 3.8 My ETF Investments\n\n**20.71% of NW**\n\n|Ticker|Allocation|Value|Contributions|%ROI|$ROI|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|VGS|61.24%|$89,570|$52,930|69.22%|$36,640|\n|VAS|21.96%|$32,121|$20,291|58.30%|$11,830|\n|GHFF|16.80%|$24,578|$21,879|12.34%|$2,699|\n|**Total**|**100.00%**|**$146,269**|**$95,100**|**53.81%**|**$51,170**|\n\nI\u2019m actually most obsessed with equities. Little bits of money that grow and pay you dividends. The worst thing that happens is they go down in price! Then you can buy more or use the income from the investments to buy more! So accessible, liquid, powerful. It has been third on my list of priorities as I gathered deposits and cashed in on Super deductions. Cashflow can get tight with my Super/Property strategy and I\u2019m not very liquid. So storing cash and extra savings in ETFs is my new drug! It really adds a lot of liquidity and accessible reserves to my portfolio. I burnt myself on some fun thematics like YOLO, ARKK and HCLN over the years. When I sold most of my assets to restructure my finances in 2022 I was down 24k on those. Sold out of my oil futures, single stocks as well (wish I\u2019d kept Palantir!). Went all in on an 80/20 VGS/VAS portfolio. Recently though I have been really excited about GHHF. It has a higher Oz content than I\u2019d like at 37% so I\u2019m continuing to buy VGS as well to keep me within my desired allocation. I haven\u2019t decided yet what ratio I want of leveraged ETFs but if I know myself, it will be as close to 100% as that mathematical asymptote will let me get lol. Leverage is just so sexy the way it juices returns! \u00a0\n\n# 3.9 My Crypto Investments\n\n**$104,036.11** | **14.73% of NW** | **BCH(69%)/BTC(18%)/ETH(13%)**\n\nI am a huge fan of transparent and immutable blockchain technology. It has a lot of applications. I\u2019m still waiting for the killer app, but it isn\u2019t BTC. I bought BTC in 2017 and also sold it in 2017 because it had gone up a lot and\u00a0transactions were congested and fees were so high it was unusable as peer to peer cash. I thought it would crash because it was useless; and still is with high fees and handicapped transaction volume. Big regrets tho lol.\n\nIf you know anything about crypto I didn\u2019t sell before the BCH hard fork at least. So I got all those coins for free! Which forked twice more for BSV and XEC. In 2022 during the great restructuring I sold the latter two hard forks for free money and also 12 shitcoins I had accumulated. I kept all my BCH and add to it regularly. For me it\u2019s the most useful crypto. You can send any amount instantly, peer to peer for less than a cent to anyone, anywhere in the world! The transaction is always confirmed in the next block for immutability. I love it. Couldn\u2019t resist DCAing back into BTC because damn that thing just keeps going up! I also invest in ETH. Crystallised $34k in gains from crypto over the years so Ive only got $24k of capital in my crypto portfolio.\n\nI think there\u2019s a place for crypto in anyone\u2019s portfolio but it has to be about a project you know and think has utility. My allocation is a little high at 14.73% relative to NW. Adding to my other assets will make my crypto allocation a smaller part of my NW over time. I don\u2019t expect the growth to be as explosive going forward so it should balance out soon. Aiming for 10% allocation of my NW.\n\n# 4.0\u00a0Future Plans and Goals\n\nHaving average expenses of <40kpa means I\u2019m not far from my FIRE number! However I expect my spend to increase significantly over the next decade. We will eventually start renting a \u201cdream home\u201d or purchase a PPOR, dial up the spend on travel/hobbies and charitable giving, and setup an awesome camping rig which will have significant ownership costs. I also love a bit of luxury so my FI number is likely much higher. I guess my minimum goal is around $1.5-1.9m which is 60-76kp on a 4% SWR. I still have another 2-3 years of building my property portfolio so will need to continue working full-time for servicing. Then I\u2019m feeling a CoastFI vibe while my assets compound for me. I will work a mandated 150 hours per year minimum to maintain my pharmacy registration and fluctuate my workload as I need. The question I\u2019m mulling over is what does that CoastFI job look like over the coming years?\n\nI could easily stay with this government job as it\u2019s been very relaxing and well paid with free accommodation. The rural site is not my gf\u2019s favourite place though so I probably can\u2019t stay for more than 18 months. Have been keeping an eye on other state health jobs for internal transfer. I could go back to locuming. I have a great network and there\u2019s still plenty of work on but my gf is definitely over it having traveled with me for 4 years! It\u2019s also a more difficult lending landscape for servicing. The other option is getting into a business partnership. Having met dozens of pharmacy owners over the years I have been offered 4 partnerships. Pharmacies usually return 10-15% on owners equity! You need to be a pharmacist to own a pharmacy so there\u2019s less competition to get in. It\u2019s also a protected industry from competitors and both sides of government are pro locally-owned community pharmacies compared to the corporate pharmacy business model you see in the US, for example. It\u2019s an enticing prospect. It would be a challenge and the pay off on the back end will be great into the future. I don\u2019t know if I have it in me though when I can get to where I\u2019m going on my current \u201ceasy\u201d path. Something to contemplate as I learn and grow as a person and an investor!\u00a0\n\n# 5.0 Resources\n\nIf you want a list of resources that I liked the most from my learning I share it regularly in subs.

          "selftext": "I once worked in a call centre position for a \"middle-man\" company that assisted in retaining monthly donors to some major charities (National Breast Cancer Foundation, McGrath Foundation, Seeing Eye Dogs, I forgot the rest but others were also major ones).\n\nAll we would do are 3 minute calls, after you signed up to support a foundation in a shopping centre, verifying your details and clarifying your commitment. At this point, we would be the \"empathetic salesman\" and adjust your donation amount incase you feel you over committed. But again, the goal is retainment.\n\nIn the fine print, that no one ever reads, it says that 97% of your donation for the first 2 years goes to our company and after those 2 years your money goes to the charity itself (I dont recall if that was 100% to the charity or not). Our company operated all across Australia and even started operating the front lines trying to get people signed up. The line they would have to say is, \"The X foundation really does benefit the most from donations of 2 years or more\" and then slap on a slogan at the end which is given to us by the foundation themself. We go by scripts for just about every question you have and the answers are all to entice you to stay donating your money.\n\nFinance wise, even the people who stand in a shopping mall asking you to do monthly donations may not even work directly for that foundation. You are allowed to ask if they get commission (they do), and how much of the money goes to the charity, but that doesn't mean people won't lie.\n\nMore of a moral finance thing than a tax purposes one here. I quit after a month. If you donate directly through their website, you skip all the outside dodgy-ness.",

I checked the BSB of the account it went to, and it's another NAB account located on the south coast of NSW (I'm in Newcastle).\n\nThe bank operator said the chances of the money being returned are very slim.\n\nIt's all very strange. I have SMS 2-factor set up and didn't receive any sms during the night asking for a code for a new login, etc. I assume ive had a password leak during a hack.\n\nThe bank said it's from an IP similar to mine but located in Sydney.

I graduated a 4 year pharmacy degree in 2013 and interned for a year in 2014 at 22 years old. In 2017 I completed my MBA and also got a cash gift of $20k from my parents. Accrued $58k of HECS debt including $7,300 of indexation that took 10 years to pay off by 2024.\n\n# 1.1 Career Progression\n\nI worked in my home town for 3 years after graduation in a 9-5 before starting locum work in 2017 when my income took off. I was chasing the highest paid contracts in new locations I hadn\u2019t traveled to before. I would cover maternity/paternity contracts, owner/staff annual leave, busy holiday periods etc. This work coupled my thrill of making money with my desire to travel and see new places. I have worked in over 30 towns/cities in Australia and visited/camped in scores more in between contracts. Contracts could range from 2 weeks to 3 months.\n\nI love my job! I\u2019m a huge people person so being able to help people with their minor or major health care needs really makes me fulfilled! I have been very lucky to happen into a profession that I enjoy and has had really good wage growth.\u00a0\n\nIt was tough and stressful working as a contractor for 8 years under an ABN without annual/sick leave: sourcing contracts, negotiating contracts, syncing work calendars with social and personal commitments, living out of a cars and suitcases, driving thousands of kilometres to new jobs, difficult lending landscape, lumpy income, being away from friends and family etc. But the money was far better compared to working a regular pharmacy job. Being hourly I also maxed my workload while on contract so would routinely average 55 to 60 hours per week depending on the contract.\n\n# 1.2 Current Role\n\nIn 2025 my position is with a state government: $155k including 12.75% super. I received a $30k sign on bonus and will get a $20k retention bonus at 12 & 24 months. Accommodation is included as the location is a rural site. I work 38h Monday - Friday with an unpaid hour for lunch! The new work/life balance was great for 2 months. Then I started locuming on weekends because I\u2019m addicted to the hourly rate! Currently working 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on a Sunday for $110/h gross. So I\u2019m 52h/week across 7 days which is manageable but I (mostly my gf) would really like a day off. I\u2019m currently looking at dropping my two weekend shifts and negotiating a 14 hour shift on a Saturday at a new pharmacy for the $110/h rate! Same 52h but across 6 days. Perfect.\n\n# 2.0 Expenses and Savings Rate\n\n|Item|FY '22|FY '23|FY '24|FY '25|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Expenses**|**$38,906**|**$28,097**|**$35,143**|**$36,944**|\n|Debits|$7,391|$9,140|$3,556|$76|\n|Credit Card|$5,184|$9,207|$9,561|$19,631|\n|Joint A/c|$6,704|$9,750|$8,809|$6,481|\n|Int\u2019 Travel|$19,627|$0|$13,217|$10,756|\n||||||\n|**Post-tax SR**|**23.3%**|**77.8%**|**75.7%**|**76.3%**|\n\n# 2.1 Expenses in my 20s\n\nThrough uni (2010-2013) I worked casually at a pharmacy. Was paid quite a bit for an 18-21 year old pharmacy student so was pretty happy! Never really saved anything or invested at this stage. Lucky to live at home through my uni degree rent free. Spent all my cash buying 3 progressively more expensive second hand cars over 5 years which all needed hella repairs. Spent the rest of my money on house hold goods, food, booze, partying, drugs, domestic travel, dating, fashion, whatever. When I started working my pharmacy internship in 2014 I was paying $150/w in rent to my parents. This continued until I moved out in 2016 and had a mortgage with adult bills. Wasn\u2019t much left over after budgeting for bills and mortgage. You can see my income that year took a big dip! Was paid far more as a student than an intern!\n\n# 2.2 Adult Expenses\n\n2017 you can see my income increased a lot when I started locum work. So of course I dialled up the spend! I\u2019d converted my PPOR to an IP as I left my home town to start work on the road. So from 2017 until January 2025 I have never paid rent or a PPOR mortgage repayment. I negotiated contracts with employers to cover accommodation and usually travel costs. Sometimes it was caravan parks or motels, sometimes AirBnBs, the owner\u2019s homes or hotels. In between contracts we camp, stay with friends/family, overseas travel or book domestic accommodation. Currently I split $250/w with my gf for a room in a city I travel to for work on weekends. Having very little housing costs obviously has kept my living expenses extremely low. Not feasible forever but great to help me increase my savings rate and get a head start on investing.\n\nFortunate to have met my partner traveling in 2019 who was also on board with FI! This year she is now CoastFI on her overseas assets. We share all our living and travel expenses through a joint bank account we contribute to equally. I apportion the property portfolio equity, debt and cashflow 50/50 with her in our individual NW numbers. We have and will continue to use a mix of our cash for deposits and expenses. In the event of a breakup we will split the property assets 50/50 after paying out our individual contributions and cash in the offsets. All our other assets are separate.\n\n# 2.3 Savings Rate\n\nI keep spending pretty tight these days but I LOVE paying for convenience. I love not having to be stressed about the price of catching an Uber/Taxi, price of groceries, or buying/replacing something that I want when I need it. I don\u2019t bother tracking my spending too closely. I do have a budget that I update every year with my big known expenses and guestimates for fuel, food and discretionary spending etc but I don\u2019t reconcile it. The budgeted expenses come out pretty close to my top line spend in my Expenses/SR table so I don\u2019t feel the need to get more granular. The only thing I itemise further is international travel because that\u2019s a big part of my FI life! Savings rate has been >70% since I\u2019ve been living life thru the FI lens so I CBFd scrutinising my expenses any further.\n\n# 2.4 Lifestyle Creep\n\nI do love dropping a bomb on holidays though! 2018/19 spent $20.2k in SE Asia for 9 months meeting my gf at the end of it. 2022 I spent $19.6k on 4 months across 8 US states and Brazil. 2024 I spent $13.2k on 10 weeks in South America. 2025 I spent $10.7k on 4 weeks in the US.\u00a0\n\nAlready we've inflated our travel lifestyle by booking Airbnbs/hotels in our desired areas instead of hostels in a cheaper location. We book flights with convenient departure/arrival times even if they're more expensive. We have a spend-like-we\u2019re-rich rule on holiday to help us really enjoy ourselves. I'd love to be in a position to travel more often, upgrade to business class for flights >5 hours, dial up the luxury a lil in the accommodation we book, travel to more expensive locations, hire a private driver/tour guide, ball out on experiences in incredible locations etc. The lifestyle creep will come easy so I need to grow my NW to support the spend I want to have.\n\n# 3.0 Investing\n\n# Net Worth Summary\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Net Worth**|**$251,919**|**$390,401**|**$473,245**|**$708,486**|\n|$ increase||$138,482|$82,845|$229,240|\n|% increase||54.97%|21.22%|48.44%|\n\n# Assets\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Super|$58,227|$97,909|$134,719|$213,047|\n|Equities|$65,517|$59,176|$78,007|$146,269|\n|Property|$217,000|$206,000|$470,000|$762,500|\n|Crypto|$31,754|$56,260|$79,649|$104,036|\n|Cash|$29,607|$122,965|$88,600|$47,722|\n|Car|$9,125|$9,125|$8,000|$6,000|\n|**Total**|**$411,229**|**$551,435**|**$858,976**|**$1,273,574**|\n\n# Debt\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mortgage|$158,500|$154,995|$382,766|$567,200|\n|Credit Card|$810|$6,039|$2,964|$3,888|\n|**Total**|**$159,310**|**$161,034**|**$385,730**|**$571,088**|\n\nn.b.

From 2017 I had been \u2018investing\u2019 in assets with no real plan: penny stocks, single stocks, oil futures, crypto and some thematic ETFs. Clearly had employed zero education and strategy on how to invest in any asset class.\u00a0Had some winners and losers but ended up with a modest CGT bill. The gain pales in comparison to the returns I would have received by buying another IP or investing in my Super and ETFs since 2017 instead.\n\n# 3.2 Getting Educated\n\nIn 2022 I came back from another big, expensive, overseas holiday. I had spent all my cash and a my mix of random assets were in decline. I was again canvasing for some lucrative contracts to fill up the bank account. I knew I had to be more intentional with my money if I wanted to continue this lifestyle of travel and part-time work. I was getting into podcasts at this time and had been writing down a few book titles about investing, personal finance and self-help. So I dove into that!\n\nAfter my learning and finding r/FIAustralia and some other Subreddits I had discovered the 4% guideline and NW calculations. I was surprised to find that my NW was a touch over $250k, albeit spread across a bunch of random asset classes. Seeing that number at 29 years old was really motivating. I knew I could accelerate this journey by earning more. You can see from earnings FY23-FY25 my income increased a lot. I took less holidays but my hourly rate as a locum had also kept increasing. During downtime at work and after hours I spent an obscene amount of time devouring podcasts, books, articles, paid courses, webinars, websites, YT videos, Instagram reels, TikToks and Reddit learning as much as I could about investing, personal finance and property. I sold almost all my random mix of assets back to cash then I came up with my plan:\u00a0Super, property, ETFs, crypto. In that order.\n\n# 3.3 Super Philosophy\n\nI love Super. There is no better tax advantaged way to invest your money for building wealth. Yes Super is locked away until retirement age but that\u2019s the whole point of investing: allowing time to compound your capital by reinvesting the dividends while you add to the pile. By contributing to Super early you are allowing those extra tax dollars saved and contributed capital the longest time possible to compound, tax free!! If something catastrophic happens where I can no longer work and all my money is \u201clocked up\u201d in Super there are early access schemes, income protection, TPD insurance, government welfare programs, other assets, family and friends etc. There are myriad options to support you in the worst-case scenario instead of ignoring Super.\n\nYou really need to take care of yourself for when you\u2019re elderly and too broken to keep working. You do this by jacking your Super to the tits ASAP and then you can start bringing your retirement age back by investing outside of Super.\u00a0If you can\u2019t afford to top your Super up to the current $30k limit after your employer Super Guarantee (SG) you\u2019re probably not earning enough to retire that early anyway. Which means you should definitely prioritise Super. I love [this article](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/how-much-to-save-inside-vs-outside-super/#stages) from\u00a0[PassiveInvestingAustralia.com](http://PassiveInvestingAustralia.com)\u00a0showing how prioritising your Super as an investment will actually help you retire sooner as a low income earner. If you are a high earner you can afford to top up to $30k. You should definitely prioritise Super for the 15% (and 30% DIV293) tax rate which will be miles better than your marginal tax rates. \u00a0\n\n# 3.4 My Super Investment\n\n**$213,046.51** | **31.15% of NW**\n\nHaving the SG since I started working as a casual pharmacy student in 2011 meant I had a good head start on my balance. In 2020 I took out the COVID relief $20k. In hindsight I should have left it in there of course. Especially considering I left it in cash for over 6 months, missing the big V shaped recovery and new all time highs! Oops. In FY23 my income had increased a lot and I was looking for tax deductions. Checking MyGov, I had $90k of unused concessional contributions! I am spreading those tax deductions over 3-4 years to use them up consecutively before they expire after 5 years. I use concessional contributions and salary sacrificing to max my yearly cap and fill up previous unused caps.\n\nThrough my income and investment income in the future I always see myself maxing my contribution limit to Super. I may over invest in Super but I\u2019m not looking to retire ASAP and I plan to give a lot of my wealth away before I die. Investing in Super will give me a huge pot that could help a lot of people! I also plan on maintaining my pharmacy registration over the coming decades. I am required to work an annual 150 hours minimum. Perpetually CoastFI!\n\nI hate that DIV296 tax applies to unrealised gains. I don\u2019t mind taxing Super more above $3m on realised gains though. No one needs that much in Super. Based on my projections I will be close to that balance in 27 years at a traditional retirement age.\n\n# 3.5 Property Philosophy\n\nTalk about a tax deduction: if I love Super, then I\u2019m HORNY FOR PROPERTY! I actually don\u2019t love negative gearing though. Losing money to save your marginal tax rate is an absurd strategy but that's what we're stuck with in Australia. Can\u2019t wait to get my portfolio to neutral territory. I do love to claim the non-cash expenses like depreciation though! Leveraging to buy property is the best way to compound your capital IMO. You have way more control over your assets, can manufacture equity and directly increase the yields. You don\u2019t have that level of finesse over companies in the share market (unless you\u2019re getting a board seat lol). The massive low-cost leverage you can apply to your capital by investing in property makes it a superior investment option to build wealth compared to the light leverage you can get with equities. I think debt recycling is a really sexy strategy too and I can\u2019t wait to utilise that when we buy a home!\n\nThe reason property was second on my list of priorities over ETFs is two-fold, though related. Firstly, with leverage you can control a large dollar value of assets in the market. You want to benefit from the maximum amount of assets growing in the market for the most time possible. Secondly: government mandated inflation at 2-3% erodes the value of the debt. So you need to take on the debt and buy the assets ASAP to allow positive compounding on the largest amount of assets and negative compounding on your debt through inflation! This move was all about time. Maximising the time you control these huge assets with maximum leverage will compound better returns.\n\n# 3.6 My Property Investment\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|IPs|2.5|\n|Total Value|$1,525,000|\n|Total Debt|$1,134,400|\n|Net Value|$390,600|\n|Leverage Ratio|74%|\n|Offset Account|$47,722|\n|**Net Value**|**$438,322**|\n\n# Profit / Loss Statement\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Income|$74,620|\n|Total Expenses|$104,781|\n|Offset Gain Back|$2,983|\n|**Estimated Cashflow before tax**|**\u2013$27,178**|\n|Depreciation|$17,128|\n|Accountant Expense|$2,500|\n|Land Tax|$0|\n|Tax Rate %|39%|\n|**Estimated Cashflow after tax**|**\u2013$11,424**|\n\n# Blended Interest Rate                                                       6.25%\n\n**Equity share of $195 300 is 27.65% of NW.**\n\nIn 2016 I grossly overpaid on a house and land package in a Townsville suburb with lots of developable land AND in a flood zone! I\u2019m very nervous every wet season in NQld. But it didn\u2019t flood in 2019 (just) or during this year\u2019s flood event in March.\u00a0I knew nothing about investing in property evidenced in the fact that I was negative equity until it finally grew enough 8 years later to negate the premium I paid the developer and builder. I built this house with my then gf and still own it 50/50 as tenants in common. I put in $23k cash, she $13k, and we were $405k all in. Current valuation 600k so a pretty poor effort over 8.5 years especially as the growth only came the last 18 months. It is a 7%+ gross yield on purchase now so it has been positively geared last two FYs at least. I plan to add a 4th bedroom by enclosing a 2nd living area to add an estimated 80-90k of equity based on comparables in the suburb and selling it in 2026. I will unlock the equity as cash, get the borrowing capacity back and dissolve the complex loan product I hold over the property with my ex. I need to check with my accountant but I think I can claim the 6 year rule on partial gains up to 2022 as I haven\u2019t claimed another PPOR. I didn\u2019t get it valued at the 6 year mark though so this might prove difficult if it\u2019s even possible!\n\nSecond property was also purchased in Townsville. May \u201824, 10% down at 450k with 5.4% gross yield, cash deposit. Bank valuation this June: 575k!! Third property in Mackay. Purchased September \u201824, 10% down at 570k with 5.02% gross yield cash and equity from property #1. Bank valuation this June: $650k!! So there\u2019s almost 400k of equity in the portfolio ATM. As a pharmacist I can get 90% LVR lend no LMI without being punished on the rates. It\u2019s a great lending product and very happy to be able to take advantage! I am pre-approved for 600k more in my personal name with this loan product. I plan to use this to buy in one of three locations: Lavington, Albury; South Grafton, NSW or Bendigo, VIC. Suburb medians are 500-570k and growing with demand and supply side data metrics looking promising while gross yields of 5%+ are achievable.\n\n# 3.7 Future Property Plans\n\nI\u2019m close to my Qld land tax threshold in my personal name and want to diversify states. WA and SA have had a lot of growth and Victoria has a few investors head winds: They have a low land tax threshold (50k!) and have hostile landlord policies. There\u2019s lots of developable land down that way so will have less of a supply constraint long term compared to other markets.\u00a0There\u2019s still potential for growth but I think there\u2019s better opportunities in NSW and Qld.\n\nGoing forward I will need to utilise trust structures to preserve my borrowing capacity. Broker says I\u2019ll be tapped out with the majors after #4 but I will still be able to lend with 2nd and 3rd tier lenders, especially if I let go of property #1. My 5th purchase is going to be a commercial property. I will then pigeon pair that inside the same trust with another growth property. This will help me pay off the debt of the commercial property in the future while keeping the trust positive through this holding period. The banks can disregard the debt inside that trust if it\u2019s positive cash flow and I can lend again based on my personal capacity. Strategy has been fleshed out with my broker and tax agent. It\u2019s risky obviously but damn I just love leverage.\n\nI don\u2019t have a goal for portfolio size, equity position or cashflow, but looking at growth on a $4.5m assets base in a [Future Value calculator](https://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html?cyearsv=30&cstartingprinciplev=4%2C500%2C000&cinterestratev=5&ccontributeamountv=0&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=Calculate#calresult) looks pretty good to me! Achievable too once I move into commercial property assets where I will be buying in higher price points.\n\n# 3.8 My ETF Investments\n\n**20.71% of NW**\n\n|Ticker|Allocation|Value|Contributions|%ROI|$ROI|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|VGS|61.24%|$89,570|$52,930|69.22%|$36,640|\n|VAS|21.96%|$32,121|$20,291|58.30%|$11,830|\n|GHFF|16.80%|$24,578|$21,879|12.34%|$2,699|\n|**Total**|**100.00%**|**$146,269**|**$95,100**|**53.81%**|**$51,170**|\n\nI\u2019m actually most obsessed with equities. Little bits of money that grow and pay you dividends. The worst thing that happens is they go down in price! Then you can buy more or use the income from the investments to buy more! So accessible, liquid, powerful. It has been third on my list of priorities as I gathered deposits and cashed in on Super deductions. Cashflow can get tight with my Super/Property strategy and I\u2019m not very liquid. So storing cash and extra savings in ETFs is my new drug! It really adds a lot of liquidity and accessible reserves to my portfolio. I burnt myself on some fun thematics like YOLO, ARKK and HCLN over the years. When I sold most of my assets to restructure my finances in 2022 I was down 24k on those. Sold out of my oil futures, single stocks as well (wish I\u2019d kept Palantir!). Went all in on an 80/20 VGS/VAS portfolio. Recently though I have been really excited about GHHF. It has a higher Oz content than I\u2019d like at 37% so I\u2019m continuing to buy VGS as well to keep me within my desired allocation. I haven\u2019t decided yet what ratio I want of leveraged ETFs but if I know myself, it will be as close to 100% as that mathematical asymptote will let me get lol. Leverage is just so sexy the way it juices returns! \u00a0\n\n# 3.9 My Crypto Investments\n\n**$104,036.11** | **14.73% of NW** | **BCH(69%)/BTC(18%)/ETH(13%)**\n\nI am a huge fan of transparent and immutable blockchain technology. It has a lot of applications. I\u2019m still waiting for the killer app, but it isn\u2019t BTC. I bought BTC in 2017 and also sold it in 2017 because it had gone up a lot and\u00a0transactions were congested and fees were so high it was unusable as peer to peer cash. I thought it would crash because it was useless; and still is with high fees and handicapped transaction volume. Big regrets tho lol.\n\nIf you know anything about crypto I didn\u2019t sell before the BCH hard fork at least. So I got all those coins for free! Which forked twice more for BSV and XEC. In 2022 during the great restructuring I sold the latter two hard forks for free money and also 12 shitcoins I had accumulated. I kept all my BCH and add to it regularly. For me it\u2019s the most useful crypto. You can send any amount instantly, peer to peer for less than a cent to anyone, anywhere in the world! The transaction is always confirmed in the next block for immutability. I love it. Couldn\u2019t resist DCAing back into BTC because damn that thing just keeps going up! I also invest in ETH. Crystallised $34k in gains from crypto over the years so Ive only got $24k of capital in my crypto portfolio.\n\nI think there\u2019s a place for crypto in anyone\u2019s portfolio but it has to be about a project you know and think has utility. My allocation is a little high at 14.73% relative to NW. Adding to my other assets will make my crypto allocation a smaller part of my NW over time. I don\u2019t expect the growth to be as explosive going forward so it should balance out soon. Aiming for 10% allocation of my NW.\n\n# 4.0\u00a0Future Plans and Goals\n\nHaving average expenses of <40kpa means I\u2019m not far from my FIRE number! However I expect my spend to increase significantly over the next decade. We will eventually start renting a \u201cdream home\u201d or purchase a PPOR, dial up the spend on travel/hobbies and charitable giving, and setup an awesome camping rig which will have significant ownership costs. I also love a bit of luxury so my FI number is likely much higher. I guess my minimum goal is around $1.5-1.9m which is 60-76kp on a 4% SWR. I still have another 2-3 years of building my property portfolio so will need to continue working full-time for servicing. Then I\u2019m feeling a CoastFI vibe while my assets compound for me. I will work a mandated 150 hours per year minimum to maintain my pharmacy registration and fluctuate my workload as I need. The question I\u2019m mulling over is what does that CoastFI job look like over the coming years?\n\nI could easily stay with this government job as it\u2019s been very relaxing and well paid with free accommodation. The rural site is not my gf\u2019s favourite place though so I probably can\u2019t stay for more than 18 months. Have been keeping an eye on other state health jobs for internal transfer. I could go back to locuming. I have a great network and there\u2019s still plenty of work on but my gf is definitely over it having traveled with me for 4 years! It\u2019s also a more difficult lending landscape for servicing. The other option is getting into a business partnership. Having met dozens of pharmacy owners over the years I have been offered 4 partnerships. Pharmacies usually return 10-15% on owners equity! You need to be a pharmacist to own a pharmacy so there\u2019s less competition to get in. It\u2019s also a protected industry from competitors and both sides of government are pro locally-owned community pharmacies compared to the corporate pharmacy business model you see in the US, for example. It\u2019s an enticing prospect. It would be a challenge and the pay off on the back end will be great into the future. I don\u2019t know if I have it in me though when I can get to where I\u2019m going on my current \u201ceasy\u201d path. Something to contemplate as I learn and grow as a person and an investor!\u00a0\n\n# 5.0 Resources\n\nIf you want a list of resources that I liked the most from my learning I share it regularly in subs.

          "selftext": "I once worked in a call centre position for a \"middle-man\" company that assisted in retaining monthly donors to some major charities (National Breast Cancer Foundation, McGrath Foundation, Seeing Eye Dogs, I forgot the rest but others were also major ones).\n\nAll we would do are 3 minute calls, after you signed up to support a foundation in a shopping centre, verifying your details and clarifying your commitment. At this point, we would be the \"empathetic salesman\" and adjust your donation amount incase you feel you over committed. But again, the goal is retainment.\n\nIn the fine print, that no one ever reads, it says that 97% of your donation for the first 2 years goes to our company and after those 2 years your money goes to the charity itself (I dont recall if that was 100% to the charity or not). Our company operated all across Australia and even started operating the front lines trying to get people signed up. The line they would have to say is, \"The X foundation really does benefit the most from donations of 2 years or more\" and then slap on a slogan at the end which is given to us by the foundation themself. We go by scripts for just about every question you have and the answers are all to entice you to stay donating your money.\n\nFinance wise, even the people who stand in a shopping mall asking you to do monthly donations may not even work directly for that foundation. You are allowed to ask if they get commission (they do), and how much of the money goes to the charity, but that doesn't mean people won't lie.\n\nMore of a moral finance thing than a tax purposes one here. I quit after a month. If you donate directly through their website, you skip all the outside dodgy-ness.",

I graduated a 4 year pharmacy degree in 2013 and interned for a year in 2014 at 22 years old. In 2017 I completed my MBA and also got a cash gift of $20k from my parents. Accrued $58k of HECS debt including $7,300 of indexation that took 10 years to pay off by 2024.\n\n# 1.1 Career Progression\n\nI worked in my home town for 3 years after graduation in a 9-5 before starting locum work in 2017 when my income took off. I was chasing the highest paid contracts in new locations I hadn\u2019t traveled to before. I would cover maternity/paternity contracts, owner/staff annual leave, busy holiday periods etc. This work coupled my thrill of making money with my desire to travel and see new places. I have worked in over 30 towns/cities in Australia and visited/camped in scores more in between contracts. Contracts could range from 2 weeks to 3 months.\n\nI love my job! I\u2019m a huge people person so being able to help people with their minor or major health care needs really makes me fulfilled! I have been very lucky to happen into a profession that I enjoy and has had really good wage growth.\u00a0\n\nIt was tough and stressful working as a contractor for 8 years under an ABN without annual/sick leave: sourcing contracts, negotiating contracts, syncing work calendars with social and personal commitments, living out of a cars and suitcases, driving thousands of kilometres to new jobs, difficult lending landscape, lumpy income, being away from friends and family etc. But the money was far better compared to working a regular pharmacy job. Being hourly I also maxed my workload while on contract so would routinely average 55 to 60 hours per week depending on the contract.\n\n# 1.2 Current Role\n\nIn 2025 my position is with a state government: $155k including 12.75% super. I received a $30k sign on bonus and will get a $20k retention bonus at 12 & 24 months. Accommodation is included as the location is a rural site. I work 38h Monday - Friday with an unpaid hour for lunch! The new work/life balance was great for 2 months. Then I started locuming on weekends because I\u2019m addicted to the hourly rate! Currently working 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on a Sunday for $110/h gross. So I\u2019m 52h/week across 7 days which is manageable but I (mostly my gf) would really like a day off. I\u2019m currently looking at dropping my two weekend shifts and negotiating a 14 hour shift on a Saturday at a new pharmacy for the $110/h rate! Same 52h but across 6 days. Perfect.\n\n# 2.0 Expenses and Savings Rate\n\n|Item|FY '22|FY '23|FY '24|FY '25|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Expenses**|**$38,906**|**$28,097**|**$35,143**|**$36,944**|\n|Debits|$7,391|$9,140|$3,556|$76|\n|Credit Card|$5,184|$9,207|$9,561|$19,631|\n|Joint A/c|$6,704|$9,750|$8,809|$6,481|\n|Int\u2019 Travel|$19,627|$0|$13,217|$10,756|\n||||||\n|**Post-tax SR**|**23.3%**|**77.8%**|**75.7%**|**76.3%**|\n\n# 2.1 Expenses in my 20s\n\nThrough uni (2010-2013) I worked casually at a pharmacy. Was paid quite a bit for an 18-21 year old pharmacy student so was pretty happy! Never really saved anything or invested at this stage. Lucky to live at home through my uni degree rent free. Spent all my cash buying 3 progressively more expensive second hand cars over 5 years which all needed hella repairs. Spent the rest of my money on house hold goods, food, booze, partying, drugs, domestic travel, dating, fashion, whatever. When I started working my pharmacy internship in 2014 I was paying $150/w in rent to my parents. This continued until I moved out in 2016 and had a mortgage with adult bills. Wasn\u2019t much left over after budgeting for bills and mortgage. You can see my income that year took a big dip! Was paid far more as a student than an intern!\n\n# 2.2 Adult Expenses\n\n2017 you can see my income increased a lot when I started locum work. So of course I dialled up the spend! I\u2019d converted my PPOR to an IP as I left my home town to start work on the road. So from 2017 until January 2025 I have never paid rent or a PPOR mortgage repayment. I negotiated contracts with employers to cover accommodation and usually travel costs. Sometimes it was caravan parks or motels, sometimes AirBnBs, the owner\u2019s homes or hotels. In between contracts we camp, stay with friends/family, overseas travel or book domestic accommodation. Currently I split $250/w with my gf for a room in a city I travel to for work on weekends. Having very little housing costs obviously has kept my living expenses extremely low. Not feasible forever but great to help me increase my savings rate and get a head start on investing.\n\nFortunate to have met my partner traveling in 2019 who was also on board with FI! This year she is now CoastFI on her overseas assets. We share all our living and travel expenses through a joint bank account we contribute to equally. I apportion the property portfolio equity, debt and cashflow 50/50 with her in our individual NW numbers. We have and will continue to use a mix of our cash for deposits and expenses. In the event of a breakup we will split the property assets 50/50 after paying out our individual contributions and cash in the offsets. All our other assets are separate.\n\n# 2.3 Savings Rate\n\nI keep spending pretty tight these days but I LOVE paying for convenience. I love not having to be stressed about the price of catching an Uber/Taxi, price of groceries, or buying/replacing something that I want when I need it. I don\u2019t bother tracking my spending too closely. I do have a budget that I update every year with my big known expenses and guestimates for fuel, food and discretionary spending etc but I don\u2019t reconcile it. The budgeted expenses come out pretty close to my top line spend in my Expenses/SR table so I don\u2019t feel the need to get more granular. The only thing I itemise further is international travel because that\u2019s a big part of my FI life! Savings rate has been >70% since I\u2019ve been living life thru the FI lens so I CBFd scrutinising my expenses any further.\n\n# 2.4 Lifestyle Creep\n\nI do love dropping a bomb on holidays though! 2018/19 spent $20.2k in SE Asia for 9 months meeting my gf at the end of it. 2022 I spent $19.6k on 4 months across 8 US states and Brazil. 2024 I spent $13.2k on 10 weeks in South America. 2025 I spent $10.7k on 4 weeks in the US.\u00a0\n\nAlready we've inflated our travel lifestyle by booking Airbnbs/hotels in our desired areas instead of hostels in a cheaper location. We book flights with convenient departure/arrival times even if they're more expensive. We have a spend-like-we\u2019re-rich rule on holiday to help us really enjoy ourselves. I'd love to be in a position to travel more often, upgrade to business class for flights >5 hours, dial up the luxury a lil in the accommodation we book, travel to more expensive locations, hire a private driver/tour guide, ball out on experiences in incredible locations etc. The lifestyle creep will come easy so I need to grow my NW to support the spend I want to have.\n\n# 3.0 Investing\n\n# Net Worth Summary\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Net Worth**|**$251,919**|**$390,401**|**$473,245**|**$708,486**|\n|$ increase||$138,482|$82,845|$229,240|\n|% increase||54.97%|21.22%|48.44%|\n\n# Assets\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Super|$58,227|$97,909|$134,719|$213,047|\n|Equities|$65,517|$59,176|$78,007|$146,269|\n|Property|$217,000|$206,000|$470,000|$762,500|\n|Crypto|$31,754|$56,260|$79,649|$104,036|\n|Cash|$29,607|$122,965|$88,600|$47,722|\n|Car|$9,125|$9,125|$8,000|$6,000|\n|**Total**|**$411,229**|**$551,435**|**$858,976**|**$1,273,574**|\n\n# Debt\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mortgage|$158,500|$154,995|$382,766|$567,200|\n|Credit Card|$810|$6,039|$2,964|$3,888|\n|**Total**|**$159,310**|**$161,034**|**$385,730**|**$571,088**|\n\nn.b.

From 2017 I had been \u2018investing\u2019 in assets with no real plan: penny stocks, single stocks, oil futures, crypto and some thematic ETFs. Clearly had employed zero education and strategy on how to invest in any asset class.\u00a0Had some winners and losers but ended up with a modest CGT bill. The gain pales in comparison to the returns I would have received by buying another IP or investing in my Super and ETFs since 2017 instead.\n\n# 3.2 Getting Educated\n\nIn 2022 I came back from another big, expensive, overseas holiday. I had spent all my cash and a my mix of random assets were in decline. I was again canvasing for some lucrative contracts to fill up the bank account. I knew I had to be more intentional with my money if I wanted to continue this lifestyle of travel and part-time work. I was getting into podcasts at this time and had been writing down a few book titles about investing, personal finance and self-help. So I dove into that!\n\nAfter my learning and finding r/FIAustralia and some other Subreddits I had discovered the 4% guideline and NW calculations. I was surprised to find that my NW was a touch over $250k, albeit spread across a bunch of random asset classes. Seeing that number at 29 years old was really motivating. I knew I could accelerate this journey by earning more. You can see from earnings FY23-FY25 my income increased a lot. I took less holidays but my hourly rate as a locum had also kept increasing. During downtime at work and after hours I spent an obscene amount of time devouring podcasts, books, articles, paid courses, webinars, websites, YT videos, Instagram reels, TikToks and Reddit learning as much as I could about investing, personal finance and property. I sold almost all my random mix of assets back to cash then I came up with my plan:\u00a0Super, property, ETFs, crypto. In that order.\n\n# 3.3 Super Philosophy\n\nI love Super. There is no better tax advantaged way to invest your money for building wealth. Yes Super is locked away until retirement age but that\u2019s the whole point of investing: allowing time to compound your capital by reinvesting the dividends while you add to the pile. By contributing to Super early you are allowing those extra tax dollars saved and contributed capital the longest time possible to compound, tax free!! If something catastrophic happens where I can no longer work and all my money is \u201clocked up\u201d in Super there are early access schemes, income protection, TPD insurance, government welfare programs, other assets, family and friends etc. There are myriad options to support you in the worst-case scenario instead of ignoring Super.\n\nYou really need to take care of yourself for when you\u2019re elderly and too broken to keep working. You do this by jacking your Super to the tits ASAP and then you can start bringing your retirement age back by investing outside of Super.\u00a0If you can\u2019t afford to top your Super up to the current $30k limit after your employer Super Guarantee (SG) you\u2019re probably not earning enough to retire that early anyway. Which means you should definitely prioritise Super. I love [this article](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/how-much-to-save-inside-vs-outside-super/#stages) from\u00a0[PassiveInvestingAustralia.com](http://PassiveInvestingAustralia.com)\u00a0showing how prioritising your Super as an investment will actually help you retire sooner as a low income earner. If you are a high earner you can afford to top up to $30k. You should definitely prioritise Super for the 15% (and 30% DIV293) tax rate which will be miles better than your marginal tax rates. \u00a0\n\n# 3.4 My Super Investment\n\n**$213,046.51** | **31.15% of NW**\n\nHaving the SG since I started working as a casual pharmacy student in 2011 meant I had a good head start on my balance. In 2020 I took out the COVID relief $20k. In hindsight I should have left it in there of course. Especially considering I left it in cash for over 6 months, missing the big V shaped recovery and new all time highs! Oops. In FY23 my income had increased a lot and I was looking for tax deductions. Checking MyGov, I had $90k of unused concessional contributions! I am spreading those tax deductions over 3-4 years to use them up consecutively before they expire after 5 years. I use concessional contributions and salary sacrificing to max my yearly cap and fill up previous unused caps.\n\nThrough my income and investment income in the future I always see myself maxing my contribution limit to Super. I may over invest in Super but I\u2019m not looking to retire ASAP and I plan to give a lot of my wealth away before I die. Investing in Super will give me a huge pot that could help a lot of people! I also plan on maintaining my pharmacy registration over the coming decades. I am required to work an annual 150 hours minimum. Perpetually CoastFI!\n\nI hate that DIV296 tax applies to unrealised gains. I don\u2019t mind taxing Super more above $3m on realised gains though. No one needs that much in Super. Based on my projections I will be close to that balance in 27 years at a traditional retirement age.\n\n# 3.5 Property Philosophy\n\nTalk about a tax deduction: if I love Super, then I\u2019m HORNY FOR PROPERTY! I actually don\u2019t love negative gearing though. Losing money to save your marginal tax rate is an absurd strategy but that's what we're stuck with in Australia. Can\u2019t wait to get my portfolio to neutral territory. I do love to claim the non-cash expenses like depreciation though! Leveraging to buy property is the best way to compound your capital IMO. You have way more control over your assets, can manufacture equity and directly increase the yields. You don\u2019t have that level of finesse over companies in the share market (unless you\u2019re getting a board seat lol). The massive low-cost leverage you can apply to your capital by investing in property makes it a superior investment option to build wealth compared to the light leverage you can get with equities. I think debt recycling is a really sexy strategy too and I can\u2019t wait to utilise that when we buy a home!\n\nThe reason property was second on my list of priorities over ETFs is two-fold, though related. Firstly, with leverage you can control a large dollar value of assets in the market. You want to benefit from the maximum amount of assets growing in the market for the most time possible. Secondly: government mandated inflation at 2-3% erodes the value of the debt. So you need to take on the debt and buy the assets ASAP to allow positive compounding on the largest amount of assets and negative compounding on your debt through inflation! This move was all about time. Maximising the time you control these huge assets with maximum leverage will compound better returns.\n\n# 3.6 My Property Investment\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|IPs|2.5|\n|Total Value|$1,525,000|\n|Total Debt|$1,134,400|\n|Net Value|$390,600|\n|Leverage Ratio|74%|\n|Offset Account|$47,722|\n|**Net Value**|**$438,322**|\n\n# Profit / Loss Statement\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Income|$74,620|\n|Total Expenses|$104,781|\n|Offset Gain Back|$2,983|\n|**Estimated Cashflow before tax**|**\u2013$27,178**|\n|Depreciation|$17,128|\n|Accountant Expense|$2,500|\n|Land Tax|$0|\n|Tax Rate %|39%|\n|**Estimated Cashflow after tax**|**\u2013$11,424**|\n\n# Blended Interest Rate                                                       6.25%\n\n**Equity share of $195 300 is 27.65% of NW.**\n\nIn 2016 I grossly overpaid on a house and land package in a Townsville suburb with lots of developable land AND in a flood zone! I\u2019m very nervous every wet season in NQld. But it didn\u2019t flood in 2019 (just) or during this year\u2019s flood event in March.\u00a0I knew nothing about investing in property evidenced in the fact that I was negative equity until it finally grew enough 8 years later to negate the premium I paid the developer and builder. I built this house with my then gf and still own it 50/50 as tenants in common. I put in $23k cash, she $13k, and we were $405k all in. Current valuation 600k so a pretty poor effort over 8.5 years especially as the growth only came the last 18 months. It is a 7%+ gross yield on purchase now so it has been positively geared last two FYs at least. I plan to add a 4th bedroom by enclosing a 2nd living area to add an estimated 80-90k of equity based on comparables in the suburb and selling it in 2026. I will unlock the equity as cash, get the borrowing capacity back and dissolve the complex loan product I hold over the property with my ex. I need to check with my accountant but I think I can claim the 6 year rule on partial gains up to 2022 as I haven\u2019t claimed another PPOR. I didn\u2019t get it valued at the 6 year mark though so this might prove difficult if it\u2019s even possible!\n\nSecond property was also purchased in Townsville. May \u201824, 10% down at 450k with 5.4% gross yield, cash deposit. Bank valuation this June: 575k!! Third property in Mackay. Purchased September \u201824, 10% down at 570k with 5.02% gross yield cash and equity from property #1. Bank valuation this June: $650k!! So there\u2019s almost 400k of equity in the portfolio ATM. As a pharmacist I can get 90% LVR lend no LMI without being punished on the rates. It\u2019s a great lending product and very happy to be able to take advantage! I am pre-approved for 600k more in my personal name with this loan product. I plan to use this to buy in one of three locations: Lavington, Albury; South Grafton, NSW or Bendigo, VIC. Suburb medians are 500-570k and growing with demand and supply side data metrics looking promising while gross yields of 5%+ are achievable.\n\n# 3.7 Future Property Plans\n\nI\u2019m close to my Qld land tax threshold in my personal name and want to diversify states. WA and SA have had a lot of growth and Victoria has a few investors head winds: They have a low land tax threshold (50k!) and have hostile landlord policies. There\u2019s lots of developable land down that way so will have less of a supply constraint long term compared to other markets.\u00a0There\u2019s still potential for growth but I think there\u2019s better opportunities in NSW and Qld.\n\nGoing forward I will need to utilise trust structures to preserve my borrowing capacity. Broker says I\u2019ll be tapped out with the majors after #4 but I will still be able to lend with 2nd and 3rd tier lenders, especially if I let go of property #1. My 5th purchase is going to be a commercial property. I will then pigeon pair that inside the same trust with another growth property. This will help me pay off the debt of the commercial property in the future while keeping the trust positive through this holding period. The banks can disregard the debt inside that trust if it\u2019s positive cash flow and I can lend again based on my personal capacity. Strategy has been fleshed out with my broker and tax agent. It\u2019s risky obviously but damn I just love leverage.\n\nI don\u2019t have a goal for portfolio size, equity position or cashflow, but looking at growth on a $4.5m assets base in a [Future Value calculator](https://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html?cyearsv=30&cstartingprinciplev=4%2C500%2C000&cinterestratev=5&ccontributeamountv=0&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=Calculate#calresult) looks pretty good to me! Achievable too once I move into commercial property assets where I will be buying in higher price points.\n\n# 3.8 My ETF Investments\n\n**20.71% of NW**\n\n|Ticker|Allocation|Value|Contributions|%ROI|$ROI|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|VGS|61.24%|$89,570|$52,930|69.22%|$36,640|\n|VAS|21.96%|$32,121|$20,291|58.30%|$11,830|\n|GHFF|16.80%|$24,578|$21,879|12.34%|$2,699|\n|**Total**|**100.00%**|**$146,269**|**$95,100**|**53.81%**|**$51,170**|\n\nI\u2019m actually most obsessed with equities. Little bits of money that grow and pay you dividends. The worst thing that happens is they go down in price! Then you can buy more or use the income from the investments to buy more! So accessible, liquid, powerful. It has been third on my list of priorities as I gathered deposits and cashed in on Super deductions. Cashflow can get tight with my Super/Property strategy and I\u2019m not very liquid. So storing cash and extra savings in ETFs is my new drug! It really adds a lot of liquidity and accessible reserves to my portfolio. I burnt myself on some fun thematics like YOLO, ARKK and HCLN over the years. When I sold most of my assets to restructure my finances in 2022 I was down 24k on those. Sold out of my oil futures, single stocks as well (wish I\u2019d kept Palantir!). Went all in on an 80/20 VGS/VAS portfolio. Recently though I have been really excited about GHHF. It has a higher Oz content than I\u2019d like at 37% so I\u2019m continuing to buy VGS as well to keep me within my desired allocation. I haven\u2019t decided yet what ratio I want of leveraged ETFs but if I know myself, it will be as close to 100% as that mathematical asymptote will let me get lol. Leverage is just so sexy the way it juices returns! \u00a0\n\n# 3.9 My Crypto Investments\n\n**$104,036.11** | **14.73% of NW** | **BCH(69%)/BTC(18%)/ETH(13%)**\n\nI am a huge fan of transparent and immutable blockchain technology. It has a lot of applications. I\u2019m still waiting for the killer app, but it isn\u2019t BTC. I bought BTC in 2017 and also sold it in 2017 because it had gone up a lot and\u00a0transactions were congested and fees were so high it was unusable as peer to peer cash. I thought it would crash because it was useless; and still is with high fees and handicapped transaction volume. Big regrets tho lol.\n\nIf you know anything about crypto I didn\u2019t sell before the BCH hard fork at least. So I got all those coins for free! Which forked twice more for BSV and XEC. In 2022 during the great restructuring I sold the latter two hard forks for free money and also 12 shitcoins I had accumulated. I kept all my BCH and add to it regularly. For me it\u2019s the most useful crypto. You can send any amount instantly, peer to peer for less than a cent to anyone, anywhere in the world! The transaction is always confirmed in the next block for immutability. I love it. Couldn\u2019t resist DCAing back into BTC because damn that thing just keeps going up! I also invest in ETH. Crystallised $34k in gains from crypto over the years so Ive only got $24k of capital in my crypto portfolio.\n\nI think there\u2019s a place for crypto in anyone\u2019s portfolio but it has to be about a project you know and think has utility. My allocation is a little high at 14.73% relative to NW. Adding to my other assets will make my crypto allocation a smaller part of my NW over time. I don\u2019t expect the growth to be as explosive going forward so it should balance out soon. Aiming for 10% allocation of my NW.\n\n# 4.0\u00a0Future Plans and Goals\n\nHaving average expenses of <40kpa means I\u2019m not far from my FIRE number! However I expect my spend to increase significantly over the next decade. We will eventually start renting a \u201cdream home\u201d or purchase a PPOR, dial up the spend on travel/hobbies and charitable giving, and setup an awesome camping rig which will have significant ownership costs. I also love a bit of luxury so my FI number is likely much higher. I guess my minimum goal is around $1.5-1.9m which is 60-76kp on a 4% SWR. I still have another 2-3 years of building my property portfolio so will need to continue working full-time for servicing. Then I\u2019m feeling a CoastFI vibe while my assets compound for me. I will work a mandated 150 hours per year minimum to maintain my pharmacy registration and fluctuate my workload as I need. The question I\u2019m mulling over is what does that CoastFI job look like over the coming years?\n\nI could easily stay with this government job as it\u2019s been very relaxing and well paid with free accommodation. The rural site is not my gf\u2019s favourite place though so I probably can\u2019t stay for more than 18 months. Have been keeping an eye on other state health jobs for internal transfer. I could go back to locuming. I have a great network and there\u2019s still plenty of work on but my gf is definitely over it having traveled with me for 4 years! It\u2019s also a more difficult lending landscape for servicing. The other option is getting into a business partnership. Having met dozens of pharmacy owners over the years I have been offered 4 partnerships. Pharmacies usually return 10-15% on owners equity! You need to be a pharmacist to own a pharmacy so there\u2019s less competition to get in. It\u2019s also a protected industry from competitors and both sides of government are pro locally-owned community pharmacies compared to the corporate pharmacy business model you see in the US, for example. It\u2019s an enticing prospect. It would be a challenge and the pay off on the back end will be great into the future. I don\u2019t know if I have it in me though when I can get to where I\u2019m going on my current \u201ceasy\u201d path. Something to contemplate as I learn and grow as a person and an investor!\u00a0\n\n# 5.0 Resources\n\nIf you want a list of resources that I liked the most from my learning I share it regularly in subs.

          "selftext": "I once worked in a call centre position for a \"middle-man\" company that assisted in retaining monthly donors to some major charities (National Breast Cancer Foundation, McGrath Foundation, Seeing Eye Dogs, I forgot the rest but others were also major ones).\n\nAll we would do are 3 minute calls, after you signed up to support a foundation in a shopping centre, verifying your details and clarifying your commitment. At this point, we would be the \"empathetic salesman\" and adjust your donation amount incase you feel you over committed. But again, the goal is retainment.\n\nIn the fine print, that no one ever reads, it says that 97% of your donation for the first 2 years goes to our company and after those 2 years your money goes to the charity itself (I dont recall if that was 100% to the charity or not). Our company operated all across Australia and even started operating the front lines trying to get people signed up. The line they would have to say is, \"The X foundation really does benefit the most from donations of 2 years or more\" and then slap on a slogan at the end which is given to us by the foundation themself. We go by scripts for just about every question you have and the answers are all to entice you to stay donating your money.\n\nFinance wise, even the people who stand in a shopping mall asking you to do monthly donations may not even work directly for that foundation. You are allowed to ask if they get commission (they do), and how much of the money goes to the charity, but that doesn't mean people won't lie.\n\nMore of a moral finance thing than a tax purposes one here. I quit after a month. If you donate directly through their website, you skip all the outside dodgy-ness.",

          "selftext": "\nHi all,\n\nLooking for some financial/life advice (Aussie-based). I\u2019m in a bit of a situation and would love some perspective:\n\nI bought a property 5 years ago for $600k, it\u2019s now worth around $750k-$800k\nI still owe $400k on the mortgage.\nThe property is currently an investment property and I get some tax benefits from holding it.\nI have a low credit score (about 450/1200) due to applying for multiple loans and credit cards over the years (some approved, some not \u2014 I know, bad decisions).\nI live paycheck to paycheck.\nMy partner and I have been together 3 years and plan to marry in buy a house in about 2 years. We'd like to buy a home together.\nHere\u2019s the opportunity:\nMy parents are coming into $1 million soon, and have offered to buy me out of my investment property. The plan would be:\n\nI transfer the property to them, they get a loan with bank\nThey pay me $250k (my equity),\nThey then take over and pay out the mortgage.\n\nMy question is:\nShould I sell the property to my parents now and take the $250k \u2014 to save or invest for a future home with my partner \u2014 OR should I hold onto the property, keep the tax benefits, and try to refinance later to get equity out?\n\nI\u2019m worried that even with $250k cash in 2 years, banks still won\u2019t lend to me due to my poor credit. But I also don\u2019t want to give up a potentially good long-term investment if I can hang onto it.\n\nAny advice or things to consider would be super appreciated \u2014 especially from anyone who's navigated poor credit, investment decisions, or lending in Australia.\n\nI am 28 years old. \n\nThanks in advance!",

I graduated a 4 year pharmacy degree in 2013 and interned for a year in 2014 at 22 years old. In 2017 I completed my MBA and also got a cash gift of $20k from my parents. Accrued $58k of HECS debt including $7,300 of indexation that took 10 years to pay off by 2024.\n\n# 1.1 Career Progression\n\nI worked in my home town for 3 years after graduation in a 9-5 before starting locum work in 2017 when my income took off. I was chasing the highest paid contracts in new locations I hadn\u2019t traveled to before. I would cover maternity/paternity contracts, owner/staff annual leave, busy holiday periods etc. This work coupled my thrill of making money with my desire to travel and see new places. I have worked in over 30 towns/cities in Australia and visited/camped in scores more in between contracts. Contracts could range from 2 weeks to 3 months.\n\nI love my job! I\u2019m a huge people person so being able to help people with their minor or major health care needs really makes me fulfilled! I have been very lucky to happen into a profession that I enjoy and has had really good wage growth.\u00a0\n\nIt was tough and stressful working as a contractor for 8 years under an ABN without annual/sick leave: sourcing contracts, negotiating contracts, syncing work calendars with social and personal commitments, living out of a cars and suitcases, driving thousands of kilometres to new jobs, difficult lending landscape, lumpy income, being away from friends and family etc. But the money was far better compared to working a regular pharmacy job. Being hourly I also maxed my workload while on contract so would routinely average 55 to 60 hours per week depending on the contract.\n\n# 1.2 Current Role\n\nIn 2025 my position is with a state government: $155k including 12.75% super. I received a $30k sign on bonus and will get a $20k retention bonus at 12 & 24 months. Accommodation is included as the location is a rural site. I work 38h Monday - Friday with an unpaid hour for lunch! The new work/life balance was great for 2 months. Then I started locuming on weekends because I\u2019m addicted to the hourly rate! Currently working 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on a Sunday for $110/h gross. So I\u2019m 52h/week across 7 days which is manageable but I (mostly my gf) would really like a day off. I\u2019m currently looking at dropping my two weekend shifts and negotiating a 14 hour shift on a Saturday at a new pharmacy for the $110/h rate! Same 52h but across 6 days. Perfect.\n\n# 2.0 Expenses and Savings Rate\n\n|Item|FY '22|FY '23|FY '24|FY '25|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Expenses**|**$38,906**|**$28,097**|**$35,143**|**$36,944**|\n|Debits|$7,391|$9,140|$3,556|$76|\n|Credit Card|$5,184|$9,207|$9,561|$19,631|\n|Joint A/c|$6,704|$9,750|$8,809|$6,481|\n|Int\u2019 Travel|$19,627|$0|$13,217|$10,756|\n||||||\n|**Post-tax SR**|**23.3%**|**77.8%**|**75.7%**|**76.3%**|\n\n# 2.1 Expenses in my 20s\n\nThrough uni (2010-2013) I worked casually at a pharmacy. Was paid quite a bit for an 18-21 year old pharmacy student so was pretty happy! Never really saved anything or invested at this stage. Lucky to live at home through my uni degree rent free. Spent all my cash buying 3 progressively more expensive second hand cars over 5 years which all needed hella repairs. Spent the rest of my money on house hold goods, food, booze, partying, drugs, domestic travel, dating, fashion, whatever. When I started working my pharmacy internship in 2014 I was paying $150/w in rent to my parents. This continued until I moved out in 2016 and had a mortgage with adult bills. Wasn\u2019t much left over after budgeting for bills and mortgage. You can see my income that year took a big dip! Was paid far more as a student than an intern!\n\n# 2.2 Adult Expenses\n\n2017 you can see my income increased a lot when I started locum work. So of course I dialled up the spend! I\u2019d converted my PPOR to an IP as I left my home town to start work on the road. So from 2017 until January 2025 I have never paid rent or a PPOR mortgage repayment. I negotiated contracts with employers to cover accommodation and usually travel costs. Sometimes it was caravan parks or motels, sometimes AirBnBs, the owner\u2019s homes or hotels. In between contracts we camp, stay with friends/family, overseas travel or book domestic accommodation. Currently I split $250/w with my gf for a room in a city I travel to for work on weekends. Having very little housing costs obviously has kept my living expenses extremely low. Not feasible forever but great to help me increase my savings rate and get a head start on investing.\n\nFortunate to have met my partner traveling in 2019 who was also on board with FI! This year she is now CoastFI on her overseas assets. We share all our living and travel expenses through a joint bank account we contribute to equally. I apportion the property portfolio equity, debt and cashflow 50/50 with her in our individual NW numbers. We have and will continue to use a mix of our cash for deposits and expenses. In the event of a breakup we will split the property assets 50/50 after paying out our individual contributions and cash in the offsets. All our other assets are separate.\n\n# 2.3 Savings Rate\n\nI keep spending pretty tight these days but I LOVE paying for convenience. I love not having to be stressed about the price of catching an Uber/Taxi, price of groceries, or buying/replacing something that I want when I need it. I don\u2019t bother tracking my spending too closely. I do have a budget that I update every year with my big known expenses and guestimates for fuel, food and discretionary spending etc but I don\u2019t reconcile it. The budgeted expenses come out pretty close to my top line spend in my Expenses/SR table so I don\u2019t feel the need to get more granular. The only thing I itemise further is international travel because that\u2019s a big part of my FI life! Savings rate has been >70% since I\u2019ve been living life thru the FI lens so I CBFd scrutinising my expenses any further.\n\n# 2.4 Lifestyle Creep\n\nI do love dropping a bomb on holidays though! 2018/19 spent $20.2k in SE Asia for 9 months meeting my gf at the end of it. 2022 I spent $19.6k on 4 months across 8 US states and Brazil. 2024 I spent $13.2k on 10 weeks in South America. 2025 I spent $10.7k on 4 weeks in the US.\u00a0\n\nAlready we've inflated our travel lifestyle by booking Airbnbs/hotels in our desired areas instead of hostels in a cheaper location. We book flights with convenient departure/arrival times even if they're more expensive. We have a spend-like-we\u2019re-rich rule on holiday to help us really enjoy ourselves. I'd love to be in a position to travel more often, upgrade to business class for flights >5 hours, dial up the luxury a lil in the accommodation we book, travel to more expensive locations, hire a private driver/tour guide, ball out on experiences in incredible locations etc. The lifestyle creep will come easy so I need to grow my NW to support the spend I want to have.\n\n# 3.0 Investing\n\n# Net Worth Summary\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Net Worth**|**$251,919**|**$390,401**|**$473,245**|**$708,486**|\n|$ increase||$138,482|$82,845|$229,240|\n|% increase||54.97%|21.22%|48.44%|\n\n# Assets\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Super|$58,227|$97,909|$134,719|$213,047|\n|Equities|$65,517|$59,176|$78,007|$146,269|\n|Property|$217,000|$206,000|$470,000|$762,500|\n|Crypto|$31,754|$56,260|$79,649|$104,036|\n|Cash|$29,607|$122,965|$88,600|$47,722|\n|Car|$9,125|$9,125|$8,000|$6,000|\n|**Total**|**$411,229**|**$551,435**|**$858,976**|**$1,273,574**|\n\n# Debt\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mortgage|$158,500|$154,995|$382,766|$567,200|\n|Credit Card|$810|$6,039|$2,964|$3,888|\n|**Total**|**$159,310**|**$161,034**|**$385,730**|**$571,088**|\n\nn.b.

From 2017 I had been \u2018investing\u2019 in assets with no real plan: penny stocks, single stocks, oil futures, crypto and some thematic ETFs. Clearly had employed zero education and strategy on how to invest in any asset class.\u00a0Had some winners and losers but ended up with a modest CGT bill. The gain pales in comparison to the returns I would have received by buying another IP or investing in my Super and ETFs since 2017 instead.\n\n# 3.2 Getting Educated\n\nIn 2022 I came back from another big, expensive, overseas holiday. I had spent all my cash and a my mix of random assets were in decline. I was again canvasing for some lucrative contracts to fill up the bank account. I knew I had to be more intentional with my money if I wanted to continue this lifestyle of travel and part-time work. I was getting into podcasts at this time and had been writing down a few book titles about investing, personal finance and self-help. So I dove into that!\n\nAfter my learning and finding r/FIAustralia and some other Subreddits I had discovered the 4% guideline and NW calculations. I was surprised to find that my NW was a touch over $250k, albeit spread across a bunch of random asset classes. Seeing that number at 29 years old was really motivating. I knew I could accelerate this journey by earning more. You can see from earnings FY23-FY25 my income increased a lot. I took less holidays but my hourly rate as a locum had also kept increasing. During downtime at work and after hours I spent an obscene amount of time devouring podcasts, books, articles, paid courses, webinars, websites, YT videos, Instagram reels, TikToks and Reddit learning as much as I could about investing, personal finance and property. I sold almost all my random mix of assets back to cash then I came up with my plan:\u00a0Super, property, ETFs, crypto. In that order.\n\n# 3.3 Super Philosophy\n\nI love Super. There is no better tax advantaged way to invest your money for building wealth. Yes Super is locked away until retirement age but that\u2019s the whole point of investing: allowing time to compound your capital by reinvesting the dividends while you add to the pile. By contributing to Super early you are allowing those extra tax dollars saved and contributed capital the longest time possible to compound, tax free!! If something catastrophic happens where I can no longer work and all my money is \u201clocked up\u201d in Super there are early access schemes, income protection, TPD insurance, government welfare programs, other assets, family and friends etc. There are myriad options to support you in the worst-case scenario instead of ignoring Super.\n\nYou really need to take care of yourself for when you\u2019re elderly and too broken to keep working. You do this by jacking your Super to the tits ASAP and then you can start bringing your retirement age back by investing outside of Super.\u00a0If you can\u2019t afford to top your Super up to the current $30k limit after your employer Super Guarantee (SG) you\u2019re probably not earning enough to retire that early anyway. Which means you should definitely prioritise Super. I love [this article](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/how-much-to-save-inside-vs-outside-super/#stages) from\u00a0[PassiveInvestingAustralia.com](http://PassiveInvestingAustralia.com)\u00a0showing how prioritising your Super as an investment will actually help you retire sooner as a low income earner. If you are a high earner you can afford to top up to $30k. You should definitely prioritise Super for the 15% (and 30% DIV293) tax rate which will be miles better than your marginal tax rates. \u00a0\n\n# 3.4 My Super Investment\n\n**$213,046.51** | **31.15% of NW**\n\nHaving the SG since I started working as a casual pharmacy student in 2011 meant I had a good head start on my balance. In 2020 I took out the COVID relief $20k. In hindsight I should have left it in there of course. Especially considering I left it in cash for over 6 months, missing the big V shaped recovery and new all time highs! Oops. In FY23 my income had increased a lot and I was looking for tax deductions. Checking MyGov, I had $90k of unused concessional contributions! I am spreading those tax deductions over 3-4 years to use them up consecutively before they expire after 5 years. I use concessional contributions and salary sacrificing to max my yearly cap and fill up previous unused caps.\n\nThrough my income and investment income in the future I always see myself maxing my contribution limit to Super. I may over invest in Super but I\u2019m not looking to retire ASAP and I plan to give a lot of my wealth away before I die. Investing in Super will give me a huge pot that could help a lot of people! I also plan on maintaining my pharmacy registration over the coming decades. I am required to work an annual 150 hours minimum. Perpetually CoastFI!\n\nI hate that DIV296 tax applies to unrealised gains. I don\u2019t mind taxing Super more above $3m on realised gains though. No one needs that much in Super. Based on my projections I will be close to that balance in 27 years at a traditional retirement age.\n\n# 3.5 Property Philosophy\n\nTalk about a tax deduction: if I love Super, then I\u2019m HORNY FOR PROPERTY! I actually don\u2019t love negative gearing though. Losing money to save your marginal tax rate is an absurd strategy but that's what we're stuck with in Australia. Can\u2019t wait to get my portfolio to neutral territory. I do love to claim the non-cash expenses like depreciation though! Leveraging to buy property is the best way to compound your capital IMO. You have way more control over your assets, can manufacture equity and directly increase the yields. You don\u2019t have that level of finesse over companies in the share market (unless you\u2019re getting a board seat lol). The massive low-cost leverage you can apply to your capital by investing in property makes it a superior investment option to build wealth compared to the light leverage you can get with equities. I think debt recycling is a really sexy strategy too and I can\u2019t wait to utilise that when we buy a home!\n\nThe reason property was second on my list of priorities over ETFs is two-fold, though related. Firstly, with leverage you can control a large dollar value of assets in the market. You want to benefit from the maximum amount of assets growing in the market for the most time possible. Secondly: government mandated inflation at 2-3% erodes the value of the debt. So you need to take on the debt and buy the assets ASAP to allow positive compounding on the largest amount of assets and negative compounding on your debt through inflation! This move was all about time. Maximising the time you control these huge assets with maximum leverage will compound better returns.\n\n# 3.6 My Property Investment\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|IPs|2.5|\n|Total Value|$1,525,000|\n|Total Debt|$1,134,400|\n|Net Value|$390,600|\n|Leverage Ratio|74%|\n|Offset Account|$47,722|\n|**Net Value**|**$438,322**|\n\n# Profit / Loss Statement\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Income|$74,620|\n|Total Expenses|$104,781|\n|Offset Gain Back|$2,983|\n|**Estimated Cashflow before tax**|**\u2013$27,178**|\n|Depreciation|$17,128|\n|Accountant Expense|$2,500|\n|Land Tax|$0|\n|Tax Rate %|39%|\n|**Estimated Cashflow after tax**|**\u2013$11,424**|\n\n# Blended Interest Rate                                                       6.25%\n\n**Equity share of $195 300 is 27.65% of NW.**\n\nIn 2016 I grossly overpaid on a house and land package in a Townsville suburb with lots of developable land AND in a flood zone! I\u2019m very nervous every wet season in NQld. But it didn\u2019t flood in 2019 (just) or during this year\u2019s flood event in March.\u00a0I knew nothing about investing in property evidenced in the fact that I was negative equity until it finally grew enough 8 years later to negate the premium I paid the developer and builder. I built this house with my then gf and still own it 50/50 as tenants in common. I put in $23k cash, she $13k, and we were $405k all in. Current valuation 600k so a pretty poor effort over 8.5 years especially as the growth only came the last 18 months. It is a 7%+ gross yield on purchase now so it has been positively geared last two FYs at least. I plan to add a 4th bedroom by enclosing a 2nd living area to add an estimated 80-90k of equity based on comparables in the suburb and selling it in 2026. I will unlock the equity as cash, get the borrowing capacity back and dissolve the complex loan product I hold over the property with my ex. I need to check with my accountant but I think I can claim the 6 year rule on partial gains up to 2022 as I haven\u2019t claimed another PPOR. I didn\u2019t get it valued at the 6 year mark though so this might prove difficult if it\u2019s even possible!\n\nSecond property was also purchased in Townsville. May \u201824, 10% down at 450k with 5.4% gross yield, cash deposit. Bank valuation this June: 575k!! Third property in Mackay. Purchased September \u201824, 10% down at 570k with 5.02% gross yield cash and equity from property #1. Bank valuation this June: $650k!! So there\u2019s almost 400k of equity in the portfolio ATM. As a pharmacist I can get 90% LVR lend no LMI without being punished on the rates. It\u2019s a great lending product and very happy to be able to take advantage! I am pre-approved for 600k more in my personal name with this loan product. I plan to use this to buy in one of three locations: Lavington, Albury; South Grafton, NSW or Bendigo, VIC. Suburb medians are 500-570k and growing with demand and supply side data metrics looking promising while gross yields of 5%+ are achievable.\n\n# 3.7 Future Property Plans\n\nI\u2019m close to my Qld land tax threshold in my personal name and want to diversify states. WA and SA have had a lot of growth and Victoria has a few investors head winds: They have a low land tax threshold (50k!) and have hostile landlord policies. There\u2019s lots of developable land down that way so will have less of a supply constraint long term compared to other markets.\u00a0There\u2019s still potential for growth but I think there\u2019s better opportunities in NSW and Qld.\n\nGoing forward I will need to utilise trust structures to preserve my borrowing capacity. Broker says I\u2019ll be tapped out with the majors after #4 but I will still be able to lend with 2nd and 3rd tier lenders, especially if I let go of property #1. My 5th purchase is going to be a commercial property. I will then pigeon pair that inside the same trust with another growth property. This will help me pay off the debt of the commercial property in the future while keeping the trust positive through this holding period. The banks can disregard the debt inside that trust if it\u2019s positive cash flow and I can lend again based on my personal capacity. Strategy has been fleshed out with my broker and tax agent. It\u2019s risky obviously but damn I just love leverage.\n\nI don\u2019t have a goal for portfolio size, equity position or cashflow, but looking at growth on a $4.5m assets base in a [Future Value calculator](https://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html?cyearsv=30&cstartingprinciplev=4%2C500%2C000&cinterestratev=5&ccontributeamountv=0&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=Calculate#calresult) looks pretty good to me! Achievable too once I move into commercial property assets where I will be buying in higher price points.\n\n# 3.8 My ETF Investments\n\n**20.71% of NW**\n\n|Ticker|Allocation|Value|Contributions|%ROI|$ROI|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|VGS|61.24%|$89,570|$52,930|69.22%|$36,640|\n|VAS|21.96%|$32,121|$20,291|58.30%|$11,830|\n|GHFF|16.80%|$24,578|$21,879|12.34%|$2,699|\n|**Total**|**100.00%**|**$146,269**|**$95,100**|**53.81%**|**$51,170**|\n\nI\u2019m actually most obsessed with equities. Little bits of money that grow and pay you dividends. The worst thing that happens is they go down in price! Then you can buy more or use the income from the investments to buy more! So accessible, liquid, powerful. It has been third on my list of priorities as I gathered deposits and cashed in on Super deductions. Cashflow can get tight with my Super/Property strategy and I\u2019m not very liquid. So storing cash and extra savings in ETFs is my new drug! It really adds a lot of liquidity and accessible reserves to my portfolio. I burnt myself on some fun thematics like YOLO, ARKK and HCLN over the years. When I sold most of my assets to restructure my finances in 2022 I was down 24k on those. Sold out of my oil futures, single stocks as well (wish I\u2019d kept Palantir!). Went all in on an 80/20 VGS/VAS portfolio. Recently though I have been really excited about GHHF. It has a higher Oz content than I\u2019d like at 37% so I\u2019m continuing to buy VGS as well to keep me within my desired allocation. I haven\u2019t decided yet what ratio I want of leveraged ETFs but if I know myself, it will be as close to 100% as that mathematical asymptote will let me get lol. Leverage is just so sexy the way it juices returns! \u00a0\n\n# 3.9 My Crypto Investments\n\n**$104,036.11** | **14.73% of NW** | **BCH(69%)/BTC(18%)/ETH(13%)**\n\nI am a huge fan of transparent and immutable blockchain technology. It has a lot of applications. I\u2019m still waiting for the killer app, but it isn\u2019t BTC. I bought BTC in 2017 and also sold it in 2017 because it had gone up a lot and\u00a0transactions were congested and fees were so high it was unusable as peer to peer cash. I thought it would crash because it was useless; and still is with high fees and handicapped transaction volume. Big regrets tho lol.\n\nIf you know anything about crypto I didn\u2019t sell before the BCH hard fork at least. So I got all those coins for free! Which forked twice more for BSV and XEC. In 2022 during the great restructuring I sold the latter two hard forks for free money and also 12 shitcoins I had accumulated. I kept all my BCH and add to it regularly. For me it\u2019s the most useful crypto. You can send any amount instantly, peer to peer for less than a cent to anyone, anywhere in the world! The transaction is always confirmed in the next block for immutability. I love it. Couldn\u2019t resist DCAing back into BTC because damn that thing just keeps going up! I also invest in ETH. Crystallised $34k in gains from crypto over the years so Ive only got $24k of capital in my crypto portfolio.\n\nI think there\u2019s a place for crypto in anyone\u2019s portfolio but it has to be about a project you know and think has utility. My allocation is a little high at 14.73% relative to NW. Adding to my other assets will make my crypto allocation a smaller part of my NW over time. I don\u2019t expect the growth to be as explosive going forward so it should balance out soon. Aiming for 10% allocation of my NW.\n\n# 4.0\u00a0Future Plans and Goals\n\nHaving average expenses of <40kpa means I\u2019m not far from my FIRE number! However I expect my spend to increase significantly over the next decade. We will eventually start renting a \u201cdream home\u201d or purchase a PPOR, dial up the spend on travel/hobbies and charitable giving, and setup an awesome camping rig which will have significant ownership costs. I also love a bit of luxury so my FI number is likely much higher. I guess my minimum goal is around $1.5-1.9m which is 60-76kp on a 4% SWR. I still have another 2-3 years of building my property portfolio so will need to continue working full-time for servicing. Then I\u2019m feeling a CoastFI vibe while my assets compound for me. I will work a mandated 150 hours per year minimum to maintain my pharmacy registration and fluctuate my workload as I need. The question I\u2019m mulling over is what does that CoastFI job look like over the coming years?\n\nI could easily stay with this government job as it\u2019s been very relaxing and well paid with free accommodation. The rural site is not my gf\u2019s favourite place though so I probably can\u2019t stay for more than 18 months. Have been keeping an eye on other state health jobs for internal transfer. I could go back to locuming. I have a great network and there\u2019s still plenty of work on but my gf is definitely over it having traveled with me for 4 years! It\u2019s also a more difficult lending landscape for servicing. The other option is getting into a business partnership. Having met dozens of pharmacy owners over the years I have been offered 4 partnerships. Pharmacies usually return 10-15% on owners equity! You need to be a pharmacist to own a pharmacy so there\u2019s less competition to get in. It\u2019s also a protected industry from competitors and both sides of government are pro locally-owned community pharmacies compared to the corporate pharmacy business model you see in the US, for example. It\u2019s an enticing prospect. It would be a challenge and the pay off on the back end will be great into the future. I don\u2019t know if I have it in me though when I can get to where I\u2019m going on my current \u201ceasy\u201d path. Something to contemplate as I learn and grow as a person and an investor!\u00a0\n\n# 5.0 Resources\n\nIf you want a list of resources that I liked the most from my learning I share it regularly in subs.

          "selftext": "I once worked in a call centre position for a \"middle-man\" company that assisted in retaining monthly donors to some major charities (National Breast Cancer Foundation, McGrath Foundation, Seeing Eye Dogs, I forgot the rest but others were also major ones).\n\nAll we would do are 3 minute calls, after you signed up to support a foundation in a shopping centre, verifying your details and clarifying your commitment. At this point, we would be the \"empathetic salesman\" and adjust your donation amount incase you feel you over committed. But again, the goal is retainment.\n\nIn the fine print, that no one ever reads, it says that 97% of your donation for the first 2 years goes to our company and after those 2 years your money goes to the charity itself (I dont recall if that was 100% to the charity or not). Our company operated all across Australia and even started operating the front lines trying to get people signed up. The line they would have to say is, \"The X foundation really does benefit the most from donations of 2 years or more\" and then slap on a slogan at the end which is given to us by the foundation themself. We go by scripts for just about every question you have and the answers are all to entice you to stay donating your money.\n\nFinance wise, even the people who stand in a shopping mall asking you to do monthly donations may not even work directly for that foundation. You are allowed to ask if they get commission (they do), and how much of the money goes to the charity, but that doesn't mean people won't lie.\n\nMore of a moral finance thing than a tax purposes one here. I quit after a month. If you donate directly through their website, you skip all the outside dodgy-ness.",

          "selftext": "\nHi all,\n\nLooking for some financial/life advice (Aussie-based). I\u2019m in a bit of a situation and would love some perspective:\n\nI bought a property 5 years ago for $600k, it\u2019s now worth around $750k-$800k\nI still owe $400k on the mortgage.\nThe property is currently an investment property and I get some tax benefits from holding it.\nI have a low credit score (about 450/1200) due to applying for multiple loans and credit cards over the years (some approved, some not \u2014 I know, bad decisions).\nI live paycheck to paycheck.\nMy partner and I have been together 3 years and plan to marry in buy a house in about 2 years. We'd like to buy a home together.\nHere\u2019s the opportunity:\nMy parents are coming into $1 million soon, and have offered to buy me out of my investment property. The plan would be:\n\nI transfer the property to them, they get a loan with bank\nThey pay me $250k (my equity),\nThey then take over and pay out the mortgage.\n\nMy question is:\nShould I sell the property to my parents now and take the $250k \u2014 to save or invest for a future home with my partner \u2014 OR should I hold onto the property, keep the tax benefits, and try to refinance later to get equity out?\n\nI\u2019m worried that even with $250k cash in 2 years, banks still won\u2019t lend to me due to my poor credit. But I also don\u2019t want to give up a potentially good long-term investment if I can hang onto it.\n\nAny advice or things to consider would be super appreciated \u2014 especially from anyone who's navigated poor credit, investment decisions, or lending in Australia.\n\nI am 28 years old. \n\nThanks in advance!",

I graduated a 4 year pharmacy degree in 2013 and interned for a year in 2014 at 22 years old. In 2017 I completed my MBA and also got a cash gift of $20k from my parents. Accrued $58k of HECS debt including $7,300 of indexation that took 10 years to pay off by 2024.\n\n# 1.1 Career Progression\n\nI worked in my home town for 3 years after graduation in a 9-5 before starting locum work in 2017 when my income took off. I was chasing the highest paid contracts in new locations I hadn\u2019t traveled to before. I would cover maternity/paternity contracts, owner/staff annual leave, busy holiday periods etc. This work coupled my thrill of making money with my desire to travel and see new places. I have worked in over 30 towns/cities in Australia and visited/camped in scores more in between contracts. Contracts could range from 2 weeks to 3 months.\n\nI love my job! I\u2019m a huge people person so being able to help people with their minor or major health care needs really makes me fulfilled! I have been very lucky to happen into a profession that I enjoy and has had really good wage growth.\u00a0\n\nIt was tough and stressful working as a contractor for 8 years under an ABN without annual/sick leave: sourcing contracts, negotiating contracts, syncing work calendars with social and personal commitments, living out of a cars and suitcases, driving thousands of kilometres to new jobs, difficult lending landscape, lumpy income, being away from friends and family etc. But the money was far better compared to working a regular pharmacy job. Being hourly I also maxed my workload while on contract so would routinely average 55 to 60 hours per week depending on the contract.\n\n# 1.2 Current Role\n\nIn 2025 my position is with a state government: $155k including 12.75% super. I received a $30k sign on bonus and will get a $20k retention bonus at 12 & 24 months. Accommodation is included as the location is a rural site. I work 38h Monday - Friday with an unpaid hour for lunch! The new work/life balance was great for 2 months. Then I started locuming on weekends because I\u2019m addicted to the hourly rate! Currently working 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on a Sunday for $110/h gross. So I\u2019m 52h/week across 7 days which is manageable but I (mostly my gf) would really like a day off. I\u2019m currently looking at dropping my two weekend shifts and negotiating a 14 hour shift on a Saturday at a new pharmacy for the $110/h rate! Same 52h but across 6 days. Perfect.\n\n# 2.0 Expenses and Savings Rate\n\n|Item|FY '22|FY '23|FY '24|FY '25|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Expenses**|**$38,906**|**$28,097**|**$35,143**|**$36,944**|\n|Debits|$7,391|$9,140|$3,556|$76|\n|Credit Card|$5,184|$9,207|$9,561|$19,631|\n|Joint A/c|$6,704|$9,750|$8,809|$6,481|\n|Int\u2019 Travel|$19,627|$0|$13,217|$10,756|\n||||||\n|**Post-tax SR**|**23.3%**|**77.8%**|**75.7%**|**76.3%**|\n\n# 2.1 Expenses in my 20s\n\nThrough uni (2010-2013) I worked casually at a pharmacy. Was paid quite a bit for an 18-21 year old pharmacy student so was pretty happy! Never really saved anything or invested at this stage. Lucky to live at home through my uni degree rent free. Spent all my cash buying 3 progressively more expensive second hand cars over 5 years which all needed hella repairs. Spent the rest of my money on house hold goods, food, booze, partying, drugs, domestic travel, dating, fashion, whatever. When I started working my pharmacy internship in 2014 I was paying $150/w in rent to my parents. This continued until I moved out in 2016 and had a mortgage with adult bills. Wasn\u2019t much left over after budgeting for bills and mortgage. You can see my income that year took a big dip! Was paid far more as a student than an intern!\n\n# 2.2 Adult Expenses\n\n2017 you can see my income increased a lot when I started locum work. So of course I dialled up the spend! I\u2019d converted my PPOR to an IP as I left my home town to start work on the road. So from 2017 until January 2025 I have never paid rent or a PPOR mortgage repayment. I negotiated contracts with employers to cover accommodation and usually travel costs. Sometimes it was caravan parks or motels, sometimes AirBnBs, the owner\u2019s homes or hotels. In between contracts we camp, stay with friends/family, overseas travel or book domestic accommodation. Currently I split $250/w with my gf for a room in a city I travel to for work on weekends. Having very little housing costs obviously has kept my living expenses extremely low. Not feasible forever but great to help me increase my savings rate and get a head start on investing.\n\nFortunate to have met my partner traveling in 2019 who was also on board with FI! This year she is now CoastFI on her overseas assets. We share all our living and travel expenses through a joint bank account we contribute to equally. I apportion the property portfolio equity, debt and cashflow 50/50 with her in our individual NW numbers. We have and will continue to use a mix of our cash for deposits and expenses. In the event of a breakup we will split the property assets 50/50 after paying out our individual contributions and cash in the offsets. All our other assets are separate.\n\n# 2.3 Savings Rate\n\nI keep spending pretty tight these days but I LOVE paying for convenience. I love not having to be stressed about the price of catching an Uber/Taxi, price of groceries, or buying/replacing something that I want when I need it. I don\u2019t bother tracking my spending too closely. I do have a budget that I update every year with my big known expenses and guestimates for fuel, food and discretionary spending etc but I don\u2019t reconcile it. The budgeted expenses come out pretty close to my top line spend in my Expenses/SR table so I don\u2019t feel the need to get more granular. The only thing I itemise further is international travel because that\u2019s a big part of my FI life! Savings rate has been >70% since I\u2019ve been living life thru the FI lens so I CBFd scrutinising my expenses any further.\n\n# 2.4 Lifestyle Creep\n\nI do love dropping a bomb on holidays though! 2018/19 spent $20.2k in SE Asia for 9 months meeting my gf at the end of it. 2022 I spent $19.6k on 4 months across 8 US states and Brazil. 2024 I spent $13.2k on 10 weeks in South America. 2025 I spent $10.7k on 4 weeks in the US.\u00a0\n\nAlready we've inflated our travel lifestyle by booking Airbnbs/hotels in our desired areas instead of hostels in a cheaper location. We book flights with convenient departure/arrival times even if they're more expensive. We have a spend-like-we\u2019re-rich rule on holiday to help us really enjoy ourselves. I'd love to be in a position to travel more often, upgrade to business class for flights >5 hours, dial up the luxury a lil in the accommodation we book, travel to more expensive locations, hire a private driver/tour guide, ball out on experiences in incredible locations etc. The lifestyle creep will come easy so I need to grow my NW to support the spend I want to have.\n\n# 3.0 Investing\n\n# Net Worth Summary\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Net Worth**|**$251,919**|**$390,401**|**$473,245**|**$708,486**|\n|$ increase||$138,482|$82,845|$229,240|\n|% increase||54.97%|21.22%|48.44%|\n\n# Assets\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Super|$58,227|$97,909|$134,719|$213,047|\n|Equities|$65,517|$59,176|$78,007|$146,269|\n|Property|$217,000|$206,000|$470,000|$762,500|\n|Crypto|$31,754|$56,260|$79,649|$104,036|\n|Cash|$29,607|$122,965|$88,600|$47,722|\n|Car|$9,125|$9,125|$8,000|$6,000|\n|**Total**|**$411,229**|**$551,435**|**$858,976**|**$1,273,574**|\n\n# Debt\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mortgage|$158,500|$154,995|$382,766|$567,200|\n|Credit Card|$810|$6,039|$2,964|$3,888|\n|**Total**|**$159,310**|**$161,034**|**$385,730**|**$571,088**|\n\nn.b.

From 2017 I had been \u2018investing\u2019 in assets with no real plan: penny stocks, single stocks, oil futures, crypto and some thematic ETFs. Clearly had employed zero education and strategy on how to invest in any asset class.\u00a0Had some winners and losers but ended up with a modest CGT bill. The gain pales in comparison to the returns I would have received by buying another IP or investing in my Super and ETFs since 2017 instead.\n\n# 3.2 Getting Educated\n\nIn 2022 I came back from another big, expensive, overseas holiday. I had spent all my cash and a my mix of random assets were in decline. I was again canvasing for some lucrative contracts to fill up the bank account. I knew I had to be more intentional with my money if I wanted to continue this lifestyle of travel and part-time work. I was getting into podcasts at this time and had been writing down a few book titles about investing, personal finance and self-help. So I dove into that!\n\nAfter my learning and finding r/FIAustralia and some other Subreddits I had discovered the 4% guideline and NW calculations. I was surprised to find that my NW was a touch over $250k, albeit spread across a bunch of random asset classes. Seeing that number at 29 years old was really motivating. I knew I could accelerate this journey by earning more. You can see from earnings FY23-FY25 my income increased a lot. I took less holidays but my hourly rate as a locum had also kept increasing. During downtime at work and after hours I spent an obscene amount of time devouring podcasts, books, articles, paid courses, webinars, websites, YT videos, Instagram reels, TikToks and Reddit learning as much as I could about investing, personal finance and property. I sold almost all my random mix of assets back to cash then I came up with my plan:\u00a0Super, property, ETFs, crypto. In that order.\n\n# 3.3 Super Philosophy\n\nI love Super. There is no better tax advantaged way to invest your money for building wealth. Yes Super is locked away until retirement age but that\u2019s the whole point of investing: allowing time to compound your capital by reinvesting the dividends while you add to the pile. By contributing to Super early you are allowing those extra tax dollars saved and contributed capital the longest time possible to compound, tax free!! If something catastrophic happens where I can no longer work and all my money is \u201clocked up\u201d in Super there are early access schemes, income protection, TPD insurance, government welfare programs, other assets, family and friends etc. There are myriad options to support you in the worst-case scenario instead of ignoring Super.\n\nYou really need to take care of yourself for when you\u2019re elderly and too broken to keep working. You do this by jacking your Super to the tits ASAP and then you can start bringing your retirement age back by investing outside of Super.\u00a0If you can\u2019t afford to top your Super up to the current $30k limit after your employer Super Guarantee (SG) you\u2019re probably not earning enough to retire that early anyway. Which means you should definitely prioritise Super. I love [this article](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/how-much-to-save-inside-vs-outside-super/#stages) from\u00a0[PassiveInvestingAustralia.com](http://PassiveInvestingAustralia.com)\u00a0showing how prioritising your Super as an investment will actually help you retire sooner as a low income earner. If you are a high earner you can afford to top up to $30k. You should definitely prioritise Super for the 15% (and 30% DIV293) tax rate which will be miles better than your marginal tax rates. \u00a0\n\n# 3.4 My Super Investment\n\n**$213,046.51** | **31.15% of NW**\n\nHaving the SG since I started working as a casual pharmacy student in 2011 meant I had a good head start on my balance. In 2020 I took out the COVID relief $20k. In hindsight I should have left it in there of course. Especially considering I left it in cash for over 6 months, missing the big V shaped recovery and new all time highs! Oops. In FY23 my income had increased a lot and I was looking for tax deductions. Checking MyGov, I had $90k of unused concessional contributions! I am spreading those tax deductions over 3-4 years to use them up consecutively before they expire after 5 years. I use concessional contributions and salary sacrificing to max my yearly cap and fill up previous unused caps.\n\nThrough my income and investment income in the future I always see myself maxing my contribution limit to Super. I may over invest in Super but I\u2019m not looking to retire ASAP and I plan to give a lot of my wealth away before I die. Investing in Super will give me a huge pot that could help a lot of people! I also plan on maintaining my pharmacy registration over the coming decades. I am required to work an annual 150 hours minimum. Perpetually CoastFI!\n\nI hate that DIV296 tax applies to unrealised gains. I don\u2019t mind taxing Super more above $3m on realised gains though. No one needs that much in Super. Based on my projections I will be close to that balance in 27 years at a traditional retirement age.\n\n# 3.5 Property Philosophy\n\nTalk about a tax deduction: if I love Super, then I\u2019m HORNY FOR PROPERTY! I actually don\u2019t love negative gearing though. Losing money to save your marginal tax rate is an absurd strategy but that's what we're stuck with in Australia. Can\u2019t wait to get my portfolio to neutral territory. I do love to claim the non-cash expenses like depreciation though! Leveraging to buy property is the best way to compound your capital IMO. You have way more control over your assets, can manufacture equity and directly increase the yields. You don\u2019t have that level of finesse over companies in the share market (unless you\u2019re getting a board seat lol). The massive low-cost leverage you can apply to your capital by investing in property makes it a superior investment option to build wealth compared to the light leverage you can get with equities. I think debt recycling is a really sexy strategy too and I can\u2019t wait to utilise that when we buy a home!\n\nThe reason property was second on my list of priorities over ETFs is two-fold, though related. Firstly, with leverage you can control a large dollar value of assets in the market. You want to benefit from the maximum amount of assets growing in the market for the most time possible. Secondly: government mandated inflation at 2-3% erodes the value of the debt. So you need to take on the debt and buy the assets ASAP to allow positive compounding on the largest amount of assets and negative compounding on your debt through inflation! This move was all about time. Maximising the time you control these huge assets with maximum leverage will compound better returns.\n\n# 3.6 My Property Investment\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|IPs|2.5|\n|Total Value|$1,525,000|\n|Total Debt|$1,134,400|\n|Net Value|$390,600|\n|Leverage Ratio|74%|\n|Offset Account|$47,722|\n|**Net Value**|**$438,322**|\n\n# Profit / Loss Statement\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Income|$74,620|\n|Total Expenses|$104,781|\n|Offset Gain Back|$2,983|\n|**Estimated Cashflow before tax**|**\u2013$27,178**|\n|Depreciation|$17,128|\n|Accountant Expense|$2,500|\n|Land Tax|$0|\n|Tax Rate %|39%|\n|**Estimated Cashflow after tax**|**\u2013$11,424**|\n\n# Blended Interest Rate                                                       6.25%\n\n**Equity share of $195 300 is 27.65% of NW.**\n\nIn 2016 I grossly overpaid on a house and land package in a Townsville suburb with lots of developable land AND in a flood zone! I\u2019m very nervous every wet season in NQld. But it didn\u2019t flood in 2019 (just) or during this year\u2019s flood event in March.\u00a0I knew nothing about investing in property evidenced in the fact that I was negative equity until it finally grew enough 8 years later to negate the premium I paid the developer and builder. I built this house with my then gf and still own it 50/50 as tenants in common. I put in $23k cash, she $13k, and we were $405k all in. Current valuation 600k so a pretty poor effort over 8.5 years especially as the growth only came the last 18 months. It is a 7%+ gross yield on purchase now so it has been positively geared last two FYs at least. I plan to add a 4th bedroom by enclosing a 2nd living area to add an estimated 80-90k of equity based on comparables in the suburb and selling it in 2026. I will unlock the equity as cash, get the borrowing capacity back and dissolve the complex loan product I hold over the property with my ex. I need to check with my accountant but I think I can claim the 6 year rule on partial gains up to 2022 as I haven\u2019t claimed another PPOR. I didn\u2019t get it valued at the 6 year mark though so this might prove difficult if it\u2019s even possible!\n\nSecond property was also purchased in Townsville. May \u201824, 10% down at 450k with 5.4% gross yield, cash deposit. Bank valuation this June: 575k!! Third property in Mackay. Purchased September \u201824, 10% down at 570k with 5.02% gross yield cash and equity from property #1. Bank valuation this June: $650k!! So there\u2019s almost 400k of equity in the portfolio ATM. As a pharmacist I can get 90% LVR lend no LMI without being punished on the rates. It\u2019s a great lending product and very happy to be able to take advantage! I am pre-approved for 600k more in my personal name with this loan product. I plan to use this to buy in one of three locations: Lavington, Albury; South Grafton, NSW or Bendigo, VIC. Suburb medians are 500-570k and growing with demand and supply side data metrics looking promising while gross yields of 5%+ are achievable.\n\n# 3.7 Future Property Plans\n\nI\u2019m close to my Qld land tax threshold in my personal name and want to diversify states. WA and SA have had a lot of growth and Victoria has a few investors head winds: They have a low land tax threshold (50k!) and have hostile landlord policies. There\u2019s lots of developable land down that way so will have less of a supply constraint long term compared to other markets.\u00a0There\u2019s still potential for growth but I think there\u2019s better opportunities in NSW and Qld.\n\nGoing forward I will need to utilise trust structures to preserve my borrowing capacity. Broker says I\u2019ll be tapped out with the majors after #4 but I will still be able to lend with 2nd and 3rd tier lenders, especially if I let go of property #1. My 5th purchase is going to be a commercial property. I will then pigeon pair that inside the same trust with another growth property. This will help me pay off the debt of the commercial property in the future while keeping the trust positive through this holding period. The banks can disregard the debt inside that trust if it\u2019s positive cash flow and I can lend again based on my personal capacity. Strategy has been fleshed out with my broker and tax agent. It\u2019s risky obviously but damn I just love leverage.\n\nI don\u2019t have a goal for portfolio size, equity position or cashflow, but looking at growth on a $4.5m assets base in a [Future Value calculator](https://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html?cyearsv=30&cstartingprinciplev=4%2C500%2C000&cinterestratev=5&ccontributeamountv=0&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=Calculate#calresult) looks pretty good to me! Achievable too once I move into commercial property assets where I will be buying in higher price points.\n\n# 3.8 My ETF Investments\n\n**20.71% of NW**\n\n|Ticker|Allocation|Value|Contributions|%ROI|$ROI|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|VGS|61.24%|$89,570|$52,930|69.22%|$36,640|\n|VAS|21.96%|$32,121|$20,291|58.30%|$11,830|\n|GHFF|16.80%|$24,578|$21,879|12.34%|$2,699|\n|**Total**|**100.00%**|**$146,269**|**$95,100**|**53.81%**|**$51,170**|\n\nI\u2019m actually most obsessed with equities. Little bits of money that grow and pay you dividends. The worst thing that happens is they go down in price! Then you can buy more or use the income from the investments to buy more! So accessible, liquid, powerful. It has been third on my list of priorities as I gathered deposits and cashed in on Super deductions. Cashflow can get tight with my Super/Property strategy and I\u2019m not very liquid. So storing cash and extra savings in ETFs is my new drug! It really adds a lot of liquidity and accessible reserves to my portfolio. I burnt myself on some fun thematics like YOLO, ARKK and HCLN over the years. When I sold most of my assets to restructure my finances in 2022 I was down 24k on those. Sold out of my oil futures, single stocks as well (wish I\u2019d kept Palantir!). Went all in on an 80/20 VGS/VAS portfolio. Recently though I have been really excited about GHHF. It has a higher Oz content than I\u2019d like at 37% so I\u2019m continuing to buy VGS as well to keep me within my desired allocation. I haven\u2019t decided yet what ratio I want of leveraged ETFs but if I know myself, it will be as close to 100% as that mathematical asymptote will let me get lol. Leverage is just so sexy the way it juices returns! \u00a0\n\n# 3.9 My Crypto Investments\n\n**$104,036.11** | **14.73% of NW** | **BCH(69%)/BTC(18%)/ETH(13%)**\n\nI am a huge fan of transparent and immutable blockchain technology. It has a lot of applications. I\u2019m still waiting for the killer app, but it isn\u2019t BTC. I bought BTC in 2017 and also sold it in 2017 because it had gone up a lot and\u00a0transactions were congested and fees were so high it was unusable as peer to peer cash. I thought it would crash because it was useless; and still is with high fees and handicapped transaction volume. Big regrets tho lol.\n\nIf you know anything about crypto I didn\u2019t sell before the BCH hard fork at least. So I got all those coins for free! Which forked twice more for BSV and XEC. In 2022 during the great restructuring I sold the latter two hard forks for free money and also 12 shitcoins I had accumulated. I kept all my BCH and add to it regularly. For me it\u2019s the most useful crypto. You can send any amount instantly, peer to peer for less than a cent to anyone, anywhere in the world! The transaction is always confirmed in the next block for immutability. I love it. Couldn\u2019t resist DCAing back into BTC because damn that thing just keeps going up! I also invest in ETH. Crystallised $34k in gains from crypto over the years so Ive only got $24k of capital in my crypto portfolio.\n\nI think there\u2019s a place for crypto in anyone\u2019s portfolio but it has to be about a project you know and think has utility. My allocation is a little high at 14.73% relative to NW. Adding to my other assets will make my crypto allocation a smaller part of my NW over time. I don\u2019t expect the growth to be as explosive going forward so it should balance out soon. Aiming for 10% allocation of my NW.\n\n# 4.0\u00a0Future Plans and Goals\n\nHaving average expenses of <40kpa means I\u2019m not far from my FIRE number! However I expect my spend to increase significantly over the next decade. We will eventually start renting a \u201cdream home\u201d or purchase a PPOR, dial up the spend on travel/hobbies and charitable giving, and setup an awesome camping rig which will have significant ownership costs. I also love a bit of luxury so my FI number is likely much higher. I guess my minimum goal is around $1.5-1.9m which is 60-76kp on a 4% SWR. I still have another 2-3 years of building my property portfolio so will need to continue working full-time for servicing. Then I\u2019m feeling a CoastFI vibe while my assets compound for me. I will work a mandated 150 hours per year minimum to maintain my pharmacy registration and fluctuate my workload as I need. The question I\u2019m mulling over is what does that CoastFI job look like over the coming years?\n\nI could easily stay with this government job as it\u2019s been very relaxing and well paid with free accommodation. The rural site is not my gf\u2019s favourite place though so I probably can\u2019t stay for more than 18 months. Have been keeping an eye on other state health jobs for internal transfer. I could go back to locuming. I have a great network and there\u2019s still plenty of work on but my gf is definitely over it having traveled with me for 4 years! It\u2019s also a more difficult lending landscape for servicing. The other option is getting into a business partnership. Having met dozens of pharmacy owners over the years I have been offered 4 partnerships. Pharmacies usually return 10-15% on owners equity! You need to be a pharmacist to own a pharmacy so there\u2019s less competition to get in. It\u2019s also a protected industry from competitors and both sides of government are pro locally-owned community pharmacies compared to the corporate pharmacy business model you see in the US, for example. It\u2019s an enticing prospect. It would be a challenge and the pay off on the back end will be great into the future. I don\u2019t know if I have it in me though when I can get to where I\u2019m going on my current \u201ceasy\u201d path. Something to contemplate as I learn and grow as a person and an investor!\u00a0\n\n# 5.0 Resources\n\nIf you want a list of resources that I liked the most from my learning I share it regularly in subs.

          "selftext": "I once worked in a call centre position for a \"middle-man\" company that assisted in retaining monthly donors to some major charities (National Breast Cancer Foundation, McGrath Foundation, Seeing Eye Dogs, I forgot the rest but others were also major ones).\n\nAll we would do are 3 minute calls, after you signed up to support a foundation in a shopping centre, verifying your details and clarifying your commitment. At this point, we would be the \"empathetic salesman\" and adjust your donation amount incase you feel you over committed. But again, the goal is retainment.\n\nIn the fine print, that no one ever reads, it says that 97% of your donation for the first 2 years goes to our company and after those 2 years your money goes to the charity itself (I dont recall if that was 100% to the charity or not). Our company operated all across Australia and even started operating the front lines trying to get people signed up. The line they would have to say is, \"The X foundation really does benefit the most from donations of 2 years or more\" and then slap on a slogan at the end which is given to us by the foundation themself. We go by scripts for just about every question you have and the answers are all to entice you to stay donating your money.\n\nFinance wise, even the people who stand in a shopping mall asking you to do monthly donations may not even work directly for that foundation. You are allowed to ask if they get commission (they do), and how much of the money goes to the charity, but that doesn't mean people won't lie.\n\nMore of a moral finance thing than a tax purposes one here. I quit after a month. If you donate directly through their website, you skip all the outside dodgy-ness.",

          "selftext": "\nHi all,\n\nLooking for some financial/life advice (Aussie-based). I\u2019m in a bit of a situation and would love some perspective:\n\nI bought a property 5 years ago for $600k, it\u2019s now worth around $750k-$800k\nI still owe $400k on the mortgage.\nThe property is currently an investment property and I get some tax benefits from holding it.\nI have a low credit score (about 450/1200) due to applying for multiple loans and credit cards over the years (some approved, some not \u2014 I know, bad decisions).\nI live paycheck to paycheck.\nMy partner and I have been together 3 years and plan to marry in buy a house in about 2 years. We'd like to buy a home together.\nHere\u2019s the opportunity:\nMy parents are coming into $1 million soon, and have offered to buy me out of my investment property. The plan would be:\n\nI transfer the property to them, they get a loan with bank\nThey pay me $250k (my equity),\nThey then take over and pay out the mortgage.\n\nMy question is:\nShould I sell the property to my parents now and take the $250k \u2014 to save or invest for a future home with my partner \u2014 OR should I hold onto the property, keep the tax benefits, and try to refinance later to get equity out?\n\nI\u2019m worried that even with $250k cash in 2 years, banks still won\u2019t lend to me due to my poor credit. But I also don\u2019t want to give up a potentially good long-term investment if I can hang onto it.\n\nAny advice or things to consider would be super appreciated \u2014 especially from anyone who's navigated poor credit, investment decisions, or lending in Australia.\n\nI am 28 years old. \n\nThanks in advance!",

I graduated a 4 year pharmacy degree in 2013 and interned for a year in 2014 at 22 years old. In 2017 I completed my MBA and also got a cash gift of $20k from my parents. Accrued $58k of HECS debt including $7,300 of indexation that took 10 years to pay off by 2024.\n\n# 1.1 Career Progression\n\nI worked in my home town for 3 years after graduation in a 9-5 before starting locum work in 2017 when my income took off. I was chasing the highest paid contracts in new locations I hadn\u2019t traveled to before. I would cover maternity/paternity contracts, owner/staff annual leave, busy holiday periods etc. This work coupled my thrill of making money with my desire to travel and see new places. I have worked in over 30 towns/cities in Australia and visited/camped in scores more in between contracts. Contracts could range from 2 weeks to 3 months.\n\nI love my job! I\u2019m a huge people person so being able to help people with their minor or major health care needs really makes me fulfilled! I have been very lucky to happen into a profession that I enjoy and has had really good wage growth.\u00a0\n\nIt was tough and stressful working as a contractor for 8 years under an ABN without annual/sick leave: sourcing contracts, negotiating contracts, syncing work calendars with social and personal commitments, living out of a cars and suitcases, driving thousands of kilometres to new jobs, difficult lending landscape, lumpy income, being away from friends and family etc. But the money was far better compared to working a regular pharmacy job. Being hourly I also maxed my workload while on contract so would routinely average 55 to 60 hours per week depending on the contract.\n\n# 1.2 Current Role\n\nIn 2025 my position is with a state government: $155k including 12.75% super. I received a $30k sign on bonus and will get a $20k retention bonus at 12 & 24 months. Accommodation is included as the location is a rural site. I work 38h Monday - Friday with an unpaid hour for lunch! The new work/life balance was great for 2 months. Then I started locuming on weekends because I\u2019m addicted to the hourly rate! Currently working 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on a Sunday for $110/h gross. So I\u2019m 52h/week across 7 days which is manageable but I (mostly my gf) would really like a day off. I\u2019m currently looking at dropping my two weekend shifts and negotiating a 14 hour shift on a Saturday at a new pharmacy for the $110/h rate! Same 52h but across 6 days. Perfect.\n\n# 2.0 Expenses and Savings Rate\n\n|Item|FY '22|FY '23|FY '24|FY '25|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Expenses**|**$38,906**|**$28,097**|**$35,143**|**$36,944**|\n|Debits|$7,391|$9,140|$3,556|$76|\n|Credit Card|$5,184|$9,207|$9,561|$19,631|\n|Joint A/c|$6,704|$9,750|$8,809|$6,481|\n|Int\u2019 Travel|$19,627|$0|$13,217|$10,756|\n||||||\n|**Post-tax SR**|**23.3%**|**77.8%**|**75.7%**|**76.3%**|\n\n# 2.1 Expenses in my 20s\n\nThrough uni (2010-2013) I worked casually at a pharmacy. Was paid quite a bit for an 18-21 year old pharmacy student so was pretty happy! Never really saved anything or invested at this stage. Lucky to live at home through my uni degree rent free. Spent all my cash buying 3 progressively more expensive second hand cars over 5 years which all needed hella repairs. Spent the rest of my money on house hold goods, food, booze, partying, drugs, domestic travel, dating, fashion, whatever. When I started working my pharmacy internship in 2014 I was paying $150/w in rent to my parents. This continued until I moved out in 2016 and had a mortgage with adult bills. Wasn\u2019t much left over after budgeting for bills and mortgage. You can see my income that year took a big dip! Was paid far more as a student than an intern!\n\n# 2.2 Adult Expenses\n\n2017 you can see my income increased a lot when I started locum work. So of course I dialled up the spend! I\u2019d converted my PPOR to an IP as I left my home town to start work on the road. So from 2017 until January 2025 I have never paid rent or a PPOR mortgage repayment. I negotiated contracts with employers to cover accommodation and usually travel costs. Sometimes it was caravan parks or motels, sometimes AirBnBs, the owner\u2019s homes or hotels. In between contracts we camp, stay with friends/family, overseas travel or book domestic accommodation. Currently I split $250/w with my gf for a room in a city I travel to for work on weekends. Having very little housing costs obviously has kept my living expenses extremely low. Not feasible forever but great to help me increase my savings rate and get a head start on investing.\n\nFortunate to have met my partner traveling in 2019 who was also on board with FI! This year she is now CoastFI on her overseas assets. We share all our living and travel expenses through a joint bank account we contribute to equally. I apportion the property portfolio equity, debt and cashflow 50/50 with her in our individual NW numbers. We have and will continue to use a mix of our cash for deposits and expenses. In the event of a breakup we will split the property assets 50/50 after paying out our individual contributions and cash in the offsets. All our other assets are separate.\n\n# 2.3 Savings Rate\n\nI keep spending pretty tight these days but I LOVE paying for convenience. I love not having to be stressed about the price of catching an Uber/Taxi, price of groceries, or buying/replacing something that I want when I need it. I don\u2019t bother tracking my spending too closely. I do have a budget that I update every year with my big known expenses and guestimates for fuel, food and discretionary spending etc but I don\u2019t reconcile it. The budgeted expenses come out pretty close to my top line spend in my Expenses/SR table so I don\u2019t feel the need to get more granular. The only thing I itemise further is international travel because that\u2019s a big part of my FI life! Savings rate has been >70% since I\u2019ve been living life thru the FI lens so I CBFd scrutinising my expenses any further.\n\n# 2.4 Lifestyle Creep\n\nI do love dropping a bomb on holidays though! 2018/19 spent $20.2k in SE Asia for 9 months meeting my gf at the end of it. 2022 I spent $19.6k on 4 months across 8 US states and Brazil. 2024 I spent $13.2k on 10 weeks in South America. 2025 I spent $10.7k on 4 weeks in the US.\u00a0\n\nAlready we've inflated our travel lifestyle by booking Airbnbs/hotels in our desired areas instead of hostels in a cheaper location. We book flights with convenient departure/arrival times even if they're more expensive. We have a spend-like-we\u2019re-rich rule on holiday to help us really enjoy ourselves. I'd love to be in a position to travel more often, upgrade to business class for flights >5 hours, dial up the luxury a lil in the accommodation we book, travel to more expensive locations, hire a private driver/tour guide, ball out on experiences in incredible locations etc. The lifestyle creep will come easy so I need to grow my NW to support the spend I want to have.\n\n# 3.0 Investing\n\n# Net Worth Summary\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Net Worth**|**$251,919**|**$390,401**|**$473,245**|**$708,486**|\n|$ increase||$138,482|$82,845|$229,240|\n|% increase||54.97%|21.22%|48.44%|\n\n# Assets\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Super|$58,227|$97,909|$134,719|$213,047|\n|Equities|$65,517|$59,176|$78,007|$146,269|\n|Property|$217,000|$206,000|$470,000|$762,500|\n|Crypto|$31,754|$56,260|$79,649|$104,036|\n|Cash|$29,607|$122,965|$88,600|$47,722|\n|Car|$9,125|$9,125|$8,000|$6,000|\n|**Total**|**$411,229**|**$551,435**|**$858,976**|**$1,273,574**|\n\n# Debt\n\n|Item|EOFY 2022|EOFY 2023|EOFY 2024|EOFY 2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mortgage|$158,500|$154,995|$382,766|$567,200|\n|Credit Card|$810|$6,039|$2,964|$3,888|\n|**Total**|**$159,310**|**$161,034**|**$385,730**|**$571,088**|\n\nn.b.

From 2017 I had been \u2018investing\u2019 in assets with no real plan: penny stocks, single stocks, oil futures, crypto and some thematic ETFs. Clearly had employed zero education and strategy on how to invest in any asset class.\u00a0Had some winners and losers but ended up with a modest CGT bill. The gain pales in comparison to the returns I would have received by buying another IP or investing in my Super and ETFs since 2017 instead.\n\n# 3.2 Getting Educated\n\nIn 2022 I came back from another big, expensive, overseas holiday. I had spent all my cash and a my mix of random assets were in decline. I was again canvasing for some lucrative contracts to fill up the bank account. I knew I had to be more intentional with my money if I wanted to continue this lifestyle of travel and part-time work. I was getting into podcasts at this time and had been writing down a few book titles about investing, personal finance and self-help. So I dove into that!\n\nAfter my learning and finding r/FIAustralia and some other Subreddits I had discovered the 4% guideline and NW calculations. I was surprised to find that my NW was a touch over $250k, albeit spread across a bunch of random asset classes. Seeing that number at 29 years old was really motivating. I knew I could accelerate this journey by earning more. You can see from earnings FY23-FY25 my income increased a lot. I took less holidays but my hourly rate as a locum had also kept increasing. During downtime at work and after hours I spent an obscene amount of time devouring podcasts, books, articles, paid courses, webinars, websites, YT videos, Instagram reels, TikToks and Reddit learning as much as I could about investing, personal finance and property. I sold almost all my random mix of assets back to cash then I came up with my plan:\u00a0Super, property, ETFs, crypto. In that order.\n\n# 3.3 Super Philosophy\n\nI love Super. There is no better tax advantaged way to invest your money for building wealth. Yes Super is locked away until retirement age but that\u2019s the whole point of investing: allowing time to compound your capital by reinvesting the dividends while you add to the pile. By contributing to Super early you are allowing those extra tax dollars saved and contributed capital the longest time possible to compound, tax free!! If something catastrophic happens where I can no longer work and all my money is \u201clocked up\u201d in Super there are early access schemes, income protection, TPD insurance, government welfare programs, other assets, family and friends etc. There are myriad options to support you in the worst-case scenario instead of ignoring Super.\n\nYou really need to take care of yourself for when you\u2019re elderly and too broken to keep working. You do this by jacking your Super to the tits ASAP and then you can start bringing your retirement age back by investing outside of Super.\u00a0If you can\u2019t afford to top your Super up to the current $30k limit after your employer Super Guarantee (SG) you\u2019re probably not earning enough to retire that early anyway. Which means you should definitely prioritise Super. I love [this article](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/how-much-to-save-inside-vs-outside-super/#stages) from\u00a0[PassiveInvestingAustralia.com](http://PassiveInvestingAustralia.com)\u00a0showing how prioritising your Super as an investment will actually help you retire sooner as a low income earner. If you are a high earner you can afford to top up to $30k. You should definitely prioritise Super for the 15% (and 30% DIV293) tax rate which will be miles better than your marginal tax rates. \u00a0\n\n# 3.4 My Super Investment\n\n**$213,046.51** | **31.15% of NW**\n\nHaving the SG since I started working as a casual pharmacy student in 2011 meant I had a good head start on my balance. In 2020 I took out the COVID relief $20k. In hindsight I should have left it in there of course. Especially considering I left it in cash for over 6 months, missing the big V shaped recovery and new all time highs! Oops. In FY23 my income had increased a lot and I was looking for tax deductions. Checking MyGov, I had $90k of unused concessional contributions! I am spreading those tax deductions over 3-4 years to use them up consecutively before they expire after 5 years. I use concessional contributions and salary sacrificing to max my yearly cap and fill up previous unused caps.\n\nThrough my income and investment income in the future I always see myself maxing my contribution limit to Super. I may over invest in Super but I\u2019m not looking to retire ASAP and I plan to give a lot of my wealth away before I die. Investing in Super will give me a huge pot that could help a lot of people! I also plan on maintaining my pharmacy registration over the coming decades. I am required to work an annual 150 hours minimum. Perpetually CoastFI!\n\nI hate that DIV296 tax applies to unrealised gains. I don\u2019t mind taxing Super more above $3m on realised gains though. No one needs that much in Super. Based on my projections I will be close to that balance in 27 years at a traditional retirement age.\n\n# 3.5 Property Philosophy\n\nTalk about a tax deduction: if I love Super, then I\u2019m HORNY FOR PROPERTY! I actually don\u2019t love negative gearing though. Losing money to save your marginal tax rate is an absurd strategy but that's what we're stuck with in Australia. Can\u2019t wait to get my portfolio to neutral territory. I do love to claim the non-cash expenses like depreciation though! Leveraging to buy property is the best way to compound your capital IMO. You have way more control over your assets, can manufacture equity and directly increase the yields. You don\u2019t have that level of finesse over companies in the share market (unless you\u2019re getting a board seat lol). The massive low-cost leverage you can apply to your capital by investing in property makes it a superior investment option to build wealth compared to the light leverage you can get with equities. I think debt recycling is a really sexy strategy too and I can\u2019t wait to utilise that when we buy a home!\n\nThe reason property was second on my list of priorities over ETFs is two-fold, though related. Firstly, with leverage you can control a large dollar value of assets in the market. You want to benefit from the maximum amount of assets growing in the market for the most time possible. Secondly: government mandated inflation at 2-3% erodes the value of the debt. So you need to take on the debt and buy the assets ASAP to allow positive compounding on the largest amount of assets and negative compounding on your debt through inflation! This move was all about time. Maximising the time you control these huge assets with maximum leverage will compound better returns.\n\n# 3.6 My Property Investment\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|IPs|2.5|\n|Total Value|$1,525,000|\n|Total Debt|$1,134,400|\n|Net Value|$390,600|\n|Leverage Ratio|74%|\n|Offset Account|$47,722|\n|**Net Value**|**$438,322**|\n\n# Profit / Loss Statement\n\n|Item|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Income|$74,620|\n|Total Expenses|$104,781|\n|Offset Gain Back|$2,983|\n|**Estimated Cashflow before tax**|**\u2013$27,178**|\n|Depreciation|$17,128|\n|Accountant Expense|$2,500|\n|Land Tax|$0|\n|Tax Rate %|39%|\n|**Estimated Cashflow after tax**|**\u2013$11,424**|\n\n# Blended Interest Rate                                                       6.25%\n\n**Equity share of $195 300 is 27.65% of NW.**\n\nIn 2016 I grossly overpaid on a house and land package in a Townsville suburb with lots of developable land AND in a flood zone! I\u2019m very nervous every wet season in NQld. But it didn\u2019t flood in 2019 (just) or during this year\u2019s flood event in March.\u00a0I knew nothing about investing in property evidenced in the fact that I was negative equity until it finally grew enough 8 years later to negate the premium I paid the developer and builder. I built this house with my then gf and still own it 50/50 as tenants in common. I put in $23k cash, she $13k, and we were $405k all in. Current valuation 600k so a pretty poor effort over 8.5 years especially as the growth only came the last 18 months. It is a 7%+ gross yield on purchase now so it has been positively geared last two FYs at least. I plan to add a 4th bedroom by enclosing a 2nd living area to add an estimated 80-90k of equity based on comparables in the suburb and selling it in 2026. I will unlock the equity as cash, get the borrowing capacity back and dissolve the complex loan product I hold over the property with my ex. I need to check with my accountant but I think I can claim the 6 year rule on partial gains up to 2022 as I haven\u2019t claimed another PPOR. I didn\u2019t get it valued at the 6 year mark though so this might prove difficult if it\u2019s even possible!\n\nSecond property was also purchased in Townsville. May \u201824, 10% down at 450k with 5.4% gross yield, cash deposit. Bank valuation this June: 575k!! Third property in Mackay. Purchased September \u201824, 10% down at 570k with 5.02% gross yield cash and equity from property #1. Bank valuation this June: $650k!! So there\u2019s almost 400k of equity in the portfolio ATM. As a pharmacist I can get 90% LVR lend no LMI without being punished on the rates. It\u2019s a great lending product and very happy to be able to take advantage! I am pre-approved for 600k more in my personal name with this loan product. I plan to use this to buy in one of three locations: Lavington, Albury; South Grafton, NSW or Bendigo, VIC. Suburb medians are 500-570k and growing with demand and supply side data metrics looking promising while gross yields of 5%+ are achievable.\n\n# 3.7 Future Property Plans\n\nI\u2019m close to my Qld land tax threshold in my personal name and want to diversify states. WA and SA have had a lot of growth and Victoria has a few investors head winds: They have a low land tax threshold (50k!) and have hostile landlord policies. There\u2019s lots of developable land down that way so will have less of a supply constraint long term compared to other markets.\u00a0There\u2019s still potential for growth but I think there\u2019s better opportunities in NSW and Qld.\n\nGoing forward I will need to utilise trust structures to preserve my borrowing capacity. Broker says I\u2019ll be tapped out with the majors after #4 but I will still be able to lend with 2nd and 3rd tier lenders, especially if I let go of property #1. My 5th purchase is going to be a commercial property. I will then pigeon pair that inside the same trust with another growth property. This will help me pay off the debt of the commercial property in the future while keeping the trust positive through this holding period. The banks can disregard the debt inside that trust if it\u2019s positive cash flow and I can lend again based on my personal capacity. Strategy has been fleshed out with my broker and tax agent. It\u2019s risky obviously but damn I just love leverage.\n\nI don\u2019t have a goal for portfolio size, equity position or cashflow, but looking at growth on a $4.5m assets base in a [Future Value calculator](https://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html?cyearsv=30&cstartingprinciplev=4%2C500%2C000&cinterestratev=5&ccontributeamountv=0&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=Calculate#calresult) looks pretty good to me! Achievable too once I move into commercial property assets where I will be buying in higher price points.\n\n# 3.8 My ETF Investments\n\n**20.71% of NW**\n\n|Ticker|Allocation|Value|Contributions|%ROI|$ROI|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|VGS|61.24%|$89,570|$52,930|69.22%|$36,640|\n|VAS|21.96%|$32,121|$20,291|58.30%|$11,830|\n|GHFF|16.80%|$24,578|$21,879|12.34%|$2,699|\n|**Total**|**100.00%**|**$146,269**|**$95,100**|**53.81%**|**$51,170**|\n\nI\u2019m actually most obsessed with equities. Little bits of money that grow and pay you dividends. The worst thing that happens is they go down in price! Then you can buy more or use the income from the investments to buy more! So accessible, liquid, powerful. It has been third on my list of priorities as I gathered deposits and cashed in on Super deductions. Cashflow can get tight with my Super/Property strategy and I\u2019m not very liquid. So storing cash and extra savings in ETFs is my new drug! It really adds a lot of liquidity and accessible reserves to my portfolio. I burnt myself on some fun thematics like YOLO, ARKK and HCLN over the years. When I sold most of my assets to restructure my finances in 2022 I was down 24k on those. Sold out of my oil futures, single stocks as well (wish I\u2019d kept Palantir!). Went all in on an 80/20 VGS/VAS portfolio. Recently though I have been really excited about GHHF. It has a higher Oz content than I\u2019d like at 37% so I\u2019m continuing to buy VGS as well to keep me within my desired allocation. I haven\u2019t decided yet what ratio I want of leveraged ETFs but if I know myself, it will be as close to 100% as that mathematical asymptote will let me get lol. Leverage is just so sexy the way it juices returns! \u00a0\n\n# 3.9 My Crypto Investments\n\n**$104,036.11** | **14.73% of NW** | **BCH(69%)/BTC(18%)/ETH(13%)**\n\nI am a huge fan of transparent and immutable blockchain technology. It has a lot of applications. I\u2019m still waiting for the killer app, but it isn\u2019t BTC. I bought BTC in 2017 and also sold it in 2017 because it had gone up a lot and\u00a0transactions were congested and fees were so high it was unusable as peer to peer cash. I thought it would crash because it was useless; and still is with high fees and handicapped transaction volume. Big regrets tho lol.\n\nIf you know anything about crypto I didn\u2019t sell before the BCH hard fork at least. So I got all those coins for free! Which forked twice more for BSV and XEC. In 2022 during the great restructuring I sold the latter two hard forks for free money and also 12 shitcoins I had accumulated. I kept all my BCH and add to it regularly. For me it\u2019s the most useful crypto. You can send any amount instantly, peer to peer for less than a cent to anyone, anywhere in the world! The transaction is always confirmed in the next block for immutability. I love it. Couldn\u2019t resist DCAing back into BTC because damn that thing just keeps going up! I also invest in ETH. Crystallised $34k in gains from crypto over the years so Ive only got $24k of capital in my crypto portfolio.\n\nI think there\u2019s a place for crypto in anyone\u2019s portfolio but it has to be about a project you know and think has utility. My allocation is a little high at 14.73% relative to NW. Adding to my other assets will make my crypto allocation a smaller part of my NW over time. I don\u2019t expect the growth to be as explosive going forward so it should balance out soon. Aiming for 10% allocation of my NW.\n\n# 4.0\u00a0Future Plans and Goals\n\nHaving average expenses of <40kpa means I\u2019m not far from my FIRE number! However I expect my spend to increase significantly over the next decade. We will eventually start renting a \u201cdream home\u201d or purchase a PPOR, dial up the spend on travel/hobbies and charitable giving, and setup an awesome camping rig which will have significant ownership costs. I also love a bit of luxury so my FI number is likely much higher. I guess my minimum goal is around $1.5-1.9m which is 60-76kp on a 4% SWR. I still have another 2-3 years of building my property portfolio so will need to continue working full-time for servicing. Then I\u2019m feeling a CoastFI vibe while my assets compound for me. I will work a mandated 150 hours per year minimum to maintain my pharmacy registration and fluctuate my workload as I need. The question I\u2019m mulling over is what does that CoastFI job look like over the coming years?\n\nI could easily stay with this government job as it\u2019s been very relaxing and well paid with free accommodation. The rural site is not my gf\u2019s favourite place though so I probably can\u2019t stay for more than 18 months. Have been keeping an eye on other state health jobs for internal transfer. I could go back to locuming. I have a great network and there\u2019s still plenty of work on but my gf is definitely over it having traveled with me for 4 years! It\u2019s also a more difficult lending landscape for servicing. The other option is getting into a business partnership. Having met dozens of pharmacy owners over the years I have been offered 4 partnerships. Pharmacies usually return 10-15% on owners equity! You need to be a pharmacist to own a pharmacy so there\u2019s less competition to get in. It\u2019s also a protected industry from competitors and both sides of government are pro locally-owned community pharmacies compared to the corporate pharmacy business model you see in the US, for example. It\u2019s an enticing prospect. It would be a challenge and the pay off on the back end will be great into the future. I don\u2019t know if I have it in me though when I can get to where I\u2019m going on my current \u201ceasy\u201d path. Something to contemplate as I learn and grow as a person and an investor!\u00a0\n\n# 5.0 Resources\n\nIf you want a list of resources that I liked the most from my learning I share it regularly in subs.

          "selftext": "I once worked in a call centre position for a \"middle-man\" company that assisted in retaining monthly donors to some major charities (National Breast Cancer Foundation, McGrath Foundation, Seeing Eye Dogs, I forgot the rest but others were also major ones).\n\nAll we would do are 3 minute calls, after you signed up to support a foundation in a shopping centre, verifying your details and clarifying your commitment. At this point, we would be the \"empathetic salesman\" and adjust your donation amount incase you feel you over committed. But again, the goal is retainment.\n\nIn the fine print, that no one ever reads, it says that 97% of your donation for the first 2 years goes to our company and after those 2 years your money goes to the charity itself (I dont recall if that was 100% to the charity or not). Our company operated all across Australia and even started operating the front lines trying to get people signed up. The line they would have to say is, \"The X foundation really does benefit the most from donations of 2 years or more\" and then slap on a slogan at the end which is given to us by the foundation themself. We go by scripts for just about every question you have and the answers are all to entice you to stay donating your money.\n\nFinance wise, even the people who stand in a shopping mall asking you to do monthly donations may not even work directly for that foundation. You are allowed to ask if they get commission (they do), and how much of the money goes to the charity, but that doesn't mean people won't lie.\n\nMore of a moral finance thing than a tax purposes one here. I quit after a month. If you donate directly through their website, you skip all the outside dodgy-ness.",

          "selftext": "\nHi all,\n\nLooking for some financial/life advice (Aussie-based). I\u2019m in a bit of a situation and would love some perspective:\n\nI bought a property 5 years ago for $600k, it\u2019s now worth around $750k-$800k\nI still owe $400k on the mortgage.\nThe property is currently an investment property and I get some tax benefits from holding it.\nI have a low credit score (about 450/1200) due to applying for multiple loans and credit cards over the years (some approved, some not \u2014 I know, bad decisions).\nI live paycheck to paycheck.\nMy partner and I have been together 3 years and plan to marry in buy a house in about 2 years. We'd like to buy a home together.\nHere\u2019s the opportunity:\nMy parents are coming into $1 million soon, and have offered to buy me out of my investment property. The plan would be:\n\nI transfer the property to them, they get a loan with bank\nThey pay me $250k (my equity),\nThey then take over and pay out the mortgage.\n\nMy question is:\nShould I sell the property to my parents now and take the $250k \u2014 to save or invest for a future home with my partner \u2014 OR should I hold onto the property, keep the tax benefits, and try to refinance later to get equity out?\n\nI\u2019m worried that even with $250k cash in 2 years, banks still won\u2019t lend to me due to my poor credit. But I also don\u2019t want to give up a potentially good long-term investment if I can hang onto it.\n\nAny advice or things to consider would be super appreciated \u2014 especially from anyone who's navigated poor credit, investment decisions, or lending in Australia.\n\nI am 28 years old. \n\nThanks in advance!",

          "selftext": "Good morning, \n\nI did a number of searches in this subreddit for advice, but couldn't find anything. \n\nWoke up this morning to a voicemail from NAB advising account was locked for suspicious activity. \n\nChecked details while on the phone to the bank and see 3 transactions of $1900ish being transferred out. They tried $4500, but the bank blocked them. I checked the BSB of the account it went to, and it's another NAB account located on the south coast of NSW (I'm in Newcastle).\n\nThe bank operator said the chances of the money being returned are very slim.\n\nIt's all very strange. I have SMS 2-factor set up and didn't receive any sms during the night asking for a code for a new login, etc. I assume ive had a password leak during a hack.\n\nThe bank said it's from an IP similar to mine but located in Sydney. I would never log into my bank on an unknown computer, and 95% access my bank using my phone. \n\nI thought they could have gotten access through my Google account, but ive checked the activity logs and there has been nothing through my Google account from when I went to bed until I woke up. \n\nA bit concerned. Has anyone else experienced this and can offer some advice? \n\nThank you",
