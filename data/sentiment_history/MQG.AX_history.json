Our broker put us with HSBC, good rate but they made us jump through a couple hoops including paying off my HECS debt (haven\u2019t yet finalised). They also used an old return to work letter for my wife and wouldn\u2019t accept the updated one, meaning our borrowing power was reduced and our shortfall went from being nothing to a further $7,000 on settlement. I spoke to my broker concerned about this all and they have set up an application for Macquarie bank. Apparently Macquarie said they can have settlement sorted for the end of not this week but next with no worries at all. This loan was applied for late on Friday, around 4:30pm. We\u2019ve been told Macquarie have insanely fast turnaround times for approving a loan. I\u2019ve been told they will pick up the file in 2 business hours and can approve as quickly as 2 hours after that, all in all, being a 4 hour turnaround. My broker has said that we have provided them with all documentation that they will need. My broker also said speaking to her representative at Macquarie that our loan seems pretty straight forward. They have said that they will need an in person evaluation completed rather than a digital one. We brought the property significantly cheaper than what it should have been due to vendor situation so I\u2019m not concerned about the pricing of the evaluation. HSBC evaluated the property $90,000 over what we paid for it so I have no doubt this new evaluation will be fine price wise. \n\nMy question is, will they be able to provide approval tomorrow (Monday) pending the valuation? This way we at least know that the loan is sorted without having the big shortfall and paying the remainder of my HECS off (~$11K) and we will then just need to go through a couple steps to finalise. I also wonder, are Macquarie really that quick to approve? And how quick will they organise the evaluation? This was ordered late on Friday.",
