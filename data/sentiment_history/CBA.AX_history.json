Furthermore, no human being could override this, and it was supposed to be 2000 dollars a day but had been arbitrarily reduced to 500 by \"the system\". This is strange because I have never been in any sort of big debt, financial distress, scams or any other reason I shouldn't be able to withdraw more money. Was I flagged for some weird reason they can't tell me or is a computer with no human supervision really all you can grapple with unless your local branch is open?\n\nShould I go to another bank that doesn't handhold me and withhold my money from me when I'm actually in a bit of a pickle? Yes, admittedly everyone should have some cash on hand for power outages/situations like this, but your bank should not make your life harder for no reason. ",

This is strange because I have never been in any sort of big debt, financial distress, scams or any other reason I shouldn't be able to withdraw more money.

Furthermore, no human being could override this, and it was supposed to be 2000 dollars a day but had been arbitrarily reduced to 500 by \"the system\". This is strange because I have never been in any sort of big debt, financial distress, scams or any other reason I shouldn't be able to withdraw more money. Was I flagged for some weird reason they can't tell me or is a computer with no human supervision really all you can grapple with unless your local branch is open?\n\nShould I go to another bank that doesn't handhold me and withhold my money from me when I'm actually in a bit of a pickle? Yes, admittedly everyone should have some cash on hand for power outages/situations like this, but your bank should not make your life harder for no reason. ",
