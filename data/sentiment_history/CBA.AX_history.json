Furthermore, no human being could override this, and it was supposed to be 2000 dollars a day but had been arbitrarily reduced to 500 by \"the system\". This is strange because I have never been in any sort of big debt, financial distress, scams or any other reason I shouldn't be able to withdraw more money. Was I flagged for some weird reason they can't tell me or is a computer with no human supervision really all you can grapple with unless your local branch is open?\n\nShould I go to another bank that doesn't handhold me and withhold my money from me when I'm actually in a bit of a pickle? Yes, admittedly everyone should have some cash on hand for power outages/situations like this, but your bank should not make your life harder for no reason. ",

This is strange because I have never been in any sort of big debt, financial distress, scams or any other reason I shouldn't be able to withdraw more money.

Was I flagged for some weird reason they can't tell me or is a computer with no human supervision really all you can grapple with unless your local branch is open?\n\nShould I go to another bank that doesn't handhold me and withhold my money from me when I'm actually in a bit of a pickle? Yes, admittedly everyone should have some cash on hand for power outages/situations like this, but your bank should not make your life harder for no reason. ",

Furthermore, no human being could override this, and it was supposed to be 2000 dollars a day but had been arbitrarily reduced to 500 by \"the system\". This is strange because I have never been in any sort of big debt, financial distress, scams or any other reason I shouldn't be able to withdraw more money. Was I flagged for some weird reason they can't tell me or is a computer with no human supervision really all you can grapple with unless your local branch is open?\n\nShould I go to another bank that doesn't handhold me and withhold my money from me when I'm actually in a bit of a pickle? Yes, admittedly everyone should have some cash on hand for power outages/situations like this, but your bank should not make your life harder for no reason. ",

Furthermore, no human being could override this, and it was supposed to be 2000 dollars a day but had been arbitrarily reduced to 500 by \"the system\". This is strange because I have never been in any sort of big debt, financial distress, scams or any other reason I shouldn't be able to withdraw more money. Was I flagged for some weird reason they can't tell me or is a computer with no human supervision really all you can grapple with unless your local branch is open?\n\nShould I go to another bank that doesn't handhold me and withhold my money from me when I'm actually in a bit of a pickle? Yes, admittedly everyone should have some cash on hand for power outages/situations like this, but your bank should not make your life harder for no reason. ",

Furthermore, no human being could override this, and it was supposed to be 2000 dollars a day but had been arbitrarily reduced to 500 by \"the system\". This is strange because I have never been in any sort of big debt, financial distress, scams or any other reason I shouldn't be able to withdraw more money. Was I flagged for some weird reason they can't tell me or is a computer with no human supervision really all you can grapple with unless your local branch is open?\n\nShould I go to another bank that doesn't handhold me and withhold my money from me when I'm actually in a bit of a pickle? Yes, admittedly everyone should have some cash on hand for power outages/situations like this, but your bank should not make your life harder for no reason. ",

          "selftext": "Hello, maybe a super silly and mundane question, but which Australian bank with decent coverage across the country actually has decent in-person withdrawal limits for cash anymore?\n\nI was without my card and I needed cash to pay for something (which I routinely pay for using that amount of withdrawed cash, and it's not even remotely sus) and it became apparent at Commbank that I could only make a cardless cash withdrawal of up to 500 dollars a day. Furthermore, no human being could override this, and it was supposed to be 2000 dollars a day but had been arbitrarily reduced to 500 by \"the system\". This is strange because I have never been in any sort of big debt, financial distress, scams or any other reason I shouldn't be able to withdraw more money. Was I flagged for some weird reason they can't tell me or is a computer with no human supervision really all you can grapple with unless your local branch is open?\n\nShould I go to another bank that doesn't handhold me and withhold my money from me when I'm actually in a bit of a pickle? Yes, admittedly everyone should have some cash on hand for power outages/situations like this, but your bank should not make your life harder for no reason. ",

          "selftext": "Hello, maybe a super silly and mundane question, but which Australian bank with decent coverage across the country actually has decent in-person withdrawal limits for cash anymore?\n\nI was without my card and I needed cash to pay for something (which I routinely pay for using that amount of withdrawed cash, and it's not even remotely sus) and it became apparent at Commbank that I could only make a cardless cash withdrawal of up to 500 dollars a day. Furthermore, no human being could override this, and it was supposed to be 2000 dollars a day but had been arbitrarily reduced to 500 by \"the system\". This is strange because I have never been in any sort of big debt, financial distress, scams or any other reason I shouldn't be able to withdraw more money. Was I flagged for some weird reason they can't tell me or is a computer with no human supervision really all you can grapple with unless your local branch is open?\n\nShould I go to another bank that doesn't handhold me and withhold my money from me when I'm actually in a bit of a pickle? Yes, admittedly everyone should have some cash on hand for power outages/situations like this, but your bank should not make your life harder for no reason. ",

But when I tested this out using rates from CBA but looks like P&I is better by a decent margin - not sure if that's just because the IO rates are just so much higher with CBA.  \n\nI've included my very rough calculations in google sheets (link at the end of my post), but to summarise:\n\n* Borrowing 100k to invest in shares which i assume will return 10% every year (no distinction made for capital gain vs dividend)\n* To make the loan repayment I sell part of my shares each year (I've ignored CGT to simplify the calculation)\n* At the end of 5 years (seems 5 years is the longest CBA will let you have IO for) the net assets I have with P&I is higher than IO ($6175 vs -$20).\n\nIf I do this as a real world concept I would refinance my loan at least once every 5 years anyways so the loan terms would reset and I'd go back to borrowing 100k again so don't see \"having more money to invest\" as an advantage of IO vs P&I.  Am I missing something obvious?!\n\nThanks for reading this far and would welcome your thoughts - also sorry lol if I've made any obvious math or excel mistakes, I'm not that great with numbers!\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15F9C8p0ixrLthmLf0NwG7iW5cIAaFgKOL99Ij0msAso/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15F9C8p0ixrLthmLf0NwG7iW5cIAaFgKOL99Ij0msAso/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n",

Furthermore, no human being could override this, and it was supposed to be 2000 dollars a day but had been arbitrarily reduced to 500 by \"the system\".

Because the current rate is much higher than 4.49%, our mortgage broker told us that there wouldn\u2019t incur any ERA. We only just saw that we got charged around $7000 for ERA, which is about our 3 months home loan repayment. This is a third of the capital gain we made from selling the house so we are just really shocked. Tried contracting them, each time the wait time is over 1 hour and never actually spoke to anyone. Lodged complaint, got a reply saying it\u2019s going to take them 30 days to investigate. We can\u2019t live without $7000 for that long in this economy, so we went into a branch, and someone helped us got in contact with the complaints team, and finally someone emailed us back, and said nope, the ERA is correct. We challenged on how that is calculated, she said nope, it\u2019s sensitive information so can\u2019t give that to you. She gave us a formula of how the ERA is calculated, but a part of that formula which is the swap rates are completely closed off to the public, so how can we calculate it without any numbers? CBA can just unilaterally decide to take our money, at an amount they decide, and without any explanation of how they come to that amount? ",

I just cannot understand what the issue is, except that I\u2019m not a \u201c9-5\u201d worker, and they don\u2019t like that. \n\nIt\u2019s really frustrating, especially when you\u2019re declined and then offered financial support. Treating you like you\u2019re useless because you aren\u2019t the typical 9-5, and yet, people who genuinely need the support, are also denied the help. Ive known countless people personally who are swimming in debt, who have 9-5\u2019s and are STILL getting approved for personal loans, it\u2019s madness! \n\nAnybody else have this issue? \n\nEdit: I\u2019ll add I\u2019ve also offered to put the vehicle as security against the loan, and also, proved ownership of my second vehicle as well as what it\u2019s worth on the used market, to pay off a chunk of the personal loan and the interest, but STILL they REFUSE. So now, the dealer will have to put the car back on the market; as they cannot hold it any longer for me. I\u2019m extremely disheartened. ",

Because the current rate is much higher than 4.49%, our mortgage broker told us that there wouldn\u2019t incur any ERA. We only just saw that we got charged around $7000 for ERA, which is about our 3 months home loan repayment. This is a third of the capital gain we made from selling the house so we are just really shocked. Tried contracting them, each time the wait time is over 1 hour and never actually spoke to anyone. Lodged complaint, got a reply saying it\u2019s going to take them 30 days to investigate. We can\u2019t live without $7000 for that long in this economy, so we went into a branch, and someone helped us got in contact with the complaints team, and finally someone emailed us back, and said nope, the ERA is correct. We challenged on how that is calculated, she said nope, it\u2019s sensitive information so can\u2019t give that to you. She gave us a formula of how the ERA is calculated, but a part of that formula which is the swap rates are completely closed off to the public, so how can we calculate it without any numbers? CBA can just unilaterally decide to take our money, at an amount they decide, and without any explanation of how they come to that amount? ",

          "selftext": "Hello, maybe a super silly and mundane question, but which Australian bank with decent coverage across the country actually has decent in-person withdrawal limits for cash anymore?\n\nI was without my card and I needed cash to pay for something (which I routinely pay for using that amount of withdrawed cash, and it's not even remotely sus) and it became apparent at Commbank that I could only make a cardless cash withdrawal of up to 500 dollars a day. Furthermore, no human being could override this, and it was supposed to be 2000 dollars a day but had been arbitrarily reduced to 500 by \"the system\". This is strange because I have never been in any sort of big debt, financial distress, scams or any other reason I shouldn't be able to withdraw more money. Was I flagged for some weird reason they can't tell me or is a computer with no human supervision really all you can grapple with unless your local branch is open?\n\nShould I go to another bank that doesn't handhold me and withhold my money from me when I'm actually in a bit of a pickle? Yes, admittedly everyone should have some cash on hand for power outages/situations like this, but your bank should not make your life harder for no reason. ",
