├── sentiment_history/          # Historical sentiment data
│   ├── CBA.AX_history.json
│   ├── ANZ.AX_history.json
│   ├── WBC.AX_history.json
│   └── NAB.AX_history.json
└── impact_analysis/           # Impact correlation results
```

## 🚀 Integration Status

### Main System Integration
- ✅ All enhancements integrated into `NewsSentimentAnalyzer`
- ✅ Historical data automatically stored on each analysis
- ✅ Trend analysis included in sentiment results
- ✅ Enhanced event detection active for all banks
- ✅ Impact analysis available when sufficient data exists

### Data Flow Enhancement
```
News Sources → Enhanced Analysis → Historical Storage → Trend Analysis → Impact Correlation
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                   ↓               ↓
RSS + Reddit → Event Detection → JSON Storage → Momentum calc → Price correlation
```

## 🎯 Immediate Benefits

1. **Better Event Detection**: 12 event types vs 7, with regex patterns and value extraction
2. **Historical Context**: Trend analysis shows sentiment momentum and volatility
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Easy comparison across all major banks
4. **Data Persistence**: No loss of historical sentiment data
5. **Reddit Insights**: Social media sentiment integration (when configured)
6. **Statistical Validation**: Correlation analysis for strategy validation

## ⚠️ Configuration Notes

### Reddit API Setup (Optional)
To enable full Reddit functionality, add to environment:
```bash
# Reddit API credentials (optional)
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_app_name
```

### Data Storage
- Historical data stored in `data/sentiment_history/`
- Impact analysis results in `data/impact_analysis/`
- Automatic cleanup after 30 days
- JSON format for easy inspection and backup

## 📈 Next Steps (Phase 2)

Based on successful Phase 1 implementation, Phase 2 priorities:

1. **Twitter/X Integration**: Real-time social media sentiment
2. **Real-time Alerts**: Instant notifications for significant events
3. **Machine Learning**: Predictive sentiment models
4. **International Sources**: Global news impact analysis
5. **Advanced NLP**: Emotion detection and sarcasm handling

## 🎉 Summary

**Phase 1 Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

All four "quick wins" have been successfully implemented and tested:
- Reddit integration provides social media sentiment
- Historical tracking enables trend analysis
- Enhanced event detection catches more market-moving events
- Impact correlation analysis validates sentiment-price relationships

The system now provides significantly more comprehensive sentiment analysis while maintaining the same simple interface. All enhancements are production-ready and integrated into the main trading system.
