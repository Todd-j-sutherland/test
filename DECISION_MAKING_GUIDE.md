# ASX Bank Trading System - Decision Making Guide üìä

## üéØ Overview

This guide explains how to interpret every metric from the Enhanced ASX Bank Trading System and how to use them for making informed trading decisions. Each metric is explained with practical examples and decision-making frameworks.

## üöÄ Quick Start: Reading Your Analysis

When you run `python enhanced_main.py`, you get output like this:

```
üìà CBA.AX: $178.00 | NEUTRAL (9.1%) | Risk: LOW (36/100) | Data: VALIDATED
    üîç VaR(95%): 2.2% | Max Drawdown: 7.0%
```

**This tells you:**
- **Price**: CBA is trading at $178.00
- **Direction**: NEUTRAL prediction (no strong buy/sell signal)
- **Confidence**: Only 9.1% confidence (weak signal - proceed with caution)
- **Risk Level**: LOW risk (36/100 - suitable for conservative portfolios)
- **Data Quality**: VALIDATED (high-quality data - reliable analysis)
- **Downside Risk**: 5% chance of losing more than 2.2% in one day
- **Historical Decline**: Stock has fallen 7% from recent peak

## üìä Individual Stock Analysis - Decision Framework

### 1. **Price & Direction Analysis**

#### What It Tells You:
- **Current Price**: Latest market price in AUD
- **Direction**: AI prediction of future price movement
- **Confidence**: How certain the AI is about the prediction

#### Decision Framework:
```
BULLISH + High Confidence (>70%) = Strong BUY signal
BULLISH + Medium Confidence (30-70%) = Moderate BUY signal
BULLISH + Low Confidence (<30%) = Watch and wait

BEARISH + High Confidence (>70%) = Strong SELL signal
BEARISH + Medium Confidence (30-70%) = Reduce position
BEARISH + Low Confidence (<30%) = Watch for confirmation

NEUTRAL = Hold existing positions, no new entry
```

#### Example Decision:
```
üìà CBA.AX: $178.00 | NEUTRAL (9.1%) | Risk: LOW (36/100)
Decision: HOLD - Neutral direction with very low confidence. 
         No action needed. Monitor for stronger signals.
```

### 2. **Risk Level Assessment**

#### Risk Scores Explained:
- **LOW (0-33)**: Conservative, stable returns, suitable for retirement funds
- **MEDIUM (34-66)**: Balanced risk-reward, good for diversified portfolios
- **HIGH (67-100)**: Aggressive, higher volatility, suitable for growth portfolios

#### Position Sizing Based on Risk:
```
LOW Risk (0-33):     Can allocate 5-10% of portfolio
MEDIUM Risk (34-66): Allocate 3-7% of portfolio
HIGH Risk (67-100):  Allocate 1-5% of portfolio (speculation only)
```

#### Example Decision:
```
Risk: LOW (36/100) - This is borderline LOW/MEDIUM risk
Decision: Can allocate up to 8% of portfolio to CBA.AX
```

### 3. **Advanced Risk Metrics**

#### VaR (Value at Risk) - Your Daily Loss Protection
**What it means**: Maximum expected loss in one day with 95% confidence

```
VaR(95%): 2.2% means:
- 95% of days, you won't lose more than 2.2%
- 5% of days (1 day per month), you could lose more than 2.2%
- This helps you size positions appropriately
```

#### Position Sizing with VaR:
If you have $10,000 to invest and VaR is 2.2%:
- Maximum daily loss would be $220 (2.2% of $10,000)
- If you can only afford to lose $100/day, invest only $4,545

#### Max Drawdown - Your Pain Tolerance Test
**What it means**: Largest peak-to-trough decline in recent history

```
Max Drawdown: 7.0% means:
- Stock has fallen 7% from its recent peak
- You need to be comfortable with 7%+ declines
- If you panic at 5% losses, this stock isn't for you
```

### 4. **Data Quality - Trust Your Analysis**

#### Data Quality Levels:
- **VALIDATED**: High-quality data, analysis is reliable
- **BASIC**: Acceptable data, analysis is reasonable
- **NO_DATA**: Poor data, avoid making decisions

#### Decision Rule:
```
VALIDATED = Trust the analysis, act on signals
BASIC = Use analysis with caution, seek confirmation
NO_DATA = Don't trade based on this analysis
```

## üéØ Portfolio Risk Analysis - Your Overall Strategy

### Portfolio Volatility
**What it means**: How much your entire portfolio fluctuates

```
Portfolio Volatility: 13.1%
- Your portfolio moves up/down about 13% per year
- Lower is more stable, higher is more growth-oriented
- Compare to ASX200 (typically 12-15%)
```

### Portfolio VaR - Your Daily Portfolio Risk
**What it means**: Maximum expected portfolio loss in one day

```
Portfolio VaR (95%): 1.3%
- 95% of days, your portfolio won't lose more than 1.3%
- With $100,000 portfolio, maximum daily loss is typically $1,300
- If you can't handle $1,300 daily losses, reduce position sizes
```

### Sharpe Ratio - Your Risk-Adjusted Returns
**What it means**: How much return you get per unit of risk

```
Sharpe Ratio: 1.59
- >1.0 = Good risk-adjusted returns
- >1.5 = Very good risk-adjusted returns
- >2.0 = Excellent risk-adjusted returns
```

### Diversification Level - Your Risk Spread
**What it means**: How well your risk is distributed

```
Diversification: EXCELLENT
- EXCELLENT = Risk is well-spread, good portfolio construction
- GOOD = Reasonable diversification, some concentration
- POOR = Too much risk in few stocks, dangerous concentration
```

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Predictions - Understanding the AI

### Prediction Components (What the AI Considers):
1. **Technical Analysis (35%)**: Price charts, indicators, patterns
2. **Fundamental Analysis (25%)**: Financial health, P/E ratios, earnings
3. **Sentiment Analysis (20%)**: News, social media, market mood
4. **Market Structure (15%)**: Overall market conditions, sector trends
5. **Seasonality (5%)**: Historical seasonal patterns

### Confidence Levels:
- **High (70-100%)**: Strong agreement between all factors
- **Medium (30-70%)**: Some factors agree, others neutral
- **Low (0-30%)**: Factors disagree or are unclear

## üí° Complete Decision-Making Framework

### Step 1: Initial Screen
```
‚úÖ Data Quality = VALIDATED? (If not, skip this stock)
‚úÖ Risk Level acceptable for your portfolio?
‚úÖ VaR within your loss tolerance?
```

### Step 2: Signal Analysis
```
Direction + Confidence = Action
BULLISH + High Confidence = Strong BUY
BULLISH + Medium Confidence = Moderate BUY
BULLISH + Low Confidence = Watch list
NEUTRAL = Hold existing positions
BEARISH + Low Confidence = Watch for confirmation
BEARISH + Medium Confidence = Reduce position
BEARISH + High Confidence = Strong SELL
```

### Step 3: Position Sizing
```
Risk Level + VaR = Position Size
LOW Risk + Low VaR = Up to 10% of portfolio
MEDIUM Risk + Medium VaR = 3-7% of portfolio
HIGH Risk + High VaR = 1-3% of portfolio (speculation)
```

### Step 4: Risk Management
```
Set stop-loss at: Max Drawdown level (e.g., 7% below entry)
Set profit target at: 2-3x your risk (e.g., 14-21% above entry)
Review position when: VaR increases significantly
```

## üìà Practical Examples

### Example 1: Conservative Investment
```
üìà NAB.AX: $39.15 | NEUTRAL (0.4%) | Risk: LOW (26/100) | Data: VALIDATED
    üîç VaR(95%): 1.6% | Max Drawdown: 4.5%

Decision: HOLD/WATCH
- Low risk suitable for conservative portfolio
- Very low confidence means no clear signal
- Low VaR (1.6%) and drawdown (4.5%) = stable stock
- Can allocate up to 10% of portfolio if buying
- Set stop-loss at 4.5% below entry price
```

### Example 2: Growth Investment
```
üìà CBA.AX: $178.00 | BULLISH (75.0%) | Risk: MEDIUM (55/100) | Data: VALIDATED
    üîç VaR(95%): 2.8% | Max Drawdown: 8.2%

Decision: MODERATE BUY
- Medium risk with high confidence bullish signal
- Higher VaR (2.8%) requires careful position sizing
- Can allocate 5-7% of portfolio
- Set stop-loss at 8.2% below entry price
- Target profit: 16-25% above entry
```

### Example 3: Avoid This Trade
```
üìà WBC.AX: $33.63 | BEARISH (65.0%) | Risk: HIGH (78/100) | Data: BASIC
    üîç VaR(95%): 4.1% | Max Drawdown: 12.3%

Decision: AVOID/SELL
- High risk with bearish signal
- Basic data quality reduces confidence
- High VaR (4.1%) and drawdown (12.3%) = volatile
- If holding, consider reducing position
- Not suitable for conservative portfolios
```

## üéØ Portfolio Construction Rules

### Risk Balance:
- **Conservative Portfolio**: 70% LOW risk, 30% MEDIUM risk
- **Balanced Portfolio**: 50% LOW risk, 40% MEDIUM risk, 10% HIGH risk
- **Growth Portfolio**: 30% LOW risk, 50% MEDIUM risk, 20% HIGH risk

### Diversification Rules:
- **Maximum single stock**: 10% of portfolio
- **Maximum sector**: 25% of portfolio (all banks = 1 sector)
- **Minimum positions**: 8-10 stocks for good diversification

### VaR Portfolio Limits:
- **Conservative**: Portfolio VaR < 1.0%
- **Balanced**: Portfolio VaR < 1.5%
- **Growth**: Portfolio VaR < 2.0%

## üö® Risk Management Rules

### Stop-Loss Rules:
1. **Individual Stocks**: Set stop-loss at Max Drawdown level
2. **Portfolio**: Exit all positions if portfolio drops 10% from peak
3. **VaR Breach**: Reduce positions if daily loss exceeds VaR 3 days in a row

### Position Sizing Formula:
```
Position Size = (Risk Tolerance √∑ VaR) √ó Capital
Example: ($500 daily risk tolerance √∑ 2.2% VaR) √ó $50,000 = $1,136 position size
```

### Review Triggers:
- **Weekly**: Check if predictions changed significantly
- **Monthly**: Rebalance if positions drift >2% from target
- **Quarterly**: Full portfolio review and optimization
