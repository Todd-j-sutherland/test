# Daily Manager Weekly Command - FIXED ✅

## Issue Description
The `python daily_manager.py weekly` command was failing because it referenced several non-existent scripts and used incorrect command line arguments.

## Problems Found & Fixed

### ❌ **Before (Broken Scripts)**
1. `sentiment_threshold_calibrator.py` - **File didn't exist**
2. `market_timing_optimizer.py` - **File didn't exist** 
3. `advanced_paper_trading.py --mode weekly-report` - **Invalid argument**

### ✅ **After (Working Alternatives)**

2. **Performance Report** - `advanced_paper_trading.py --report-only`
3. **Pattern Analysis** - `analyze_trading_patterns.py`
4. **Data Quality Check** - ML pipeline validation
5. **Model Retraining** - `scripts/retrain_ml_models.py` (already working)
