    timestamp=datetime.now(),
    symbol='CBA.AX',
    sentiment_score=0.75,
    confidence=0.9,
    news_count=5,
    relevance_score=0.8
)
analyzer.add_sentiment_observation(point)
analysis = analyzer.analyze_sentiment_evolution('CBA.AX')
```

#### Feature Engineering
```python
from advanced_feature_engineering import AdvancedFeatureEngineer

engineer = AdvancedFeatureEngineer()
sentiment_data = {
    'overall_sentiment': 0.6,
    'confidence': 0.8,
    'news_count': 5
}
features = engineer.engineer_comprehensive_features('CBA.AX', sentiment_data)
```

#### Ensemble Learning
```python
from enhanced_ensemble_learning import ModelPrediction, EnhancedTransformerEnsemble

ensemble = EnhancedTransformerEnsemble()
prediction = ModelPrediction(
    model_name='test_model',
    prediction=0.75,
    confidence=0.9,
    timestamp=datetime.now()
)
# Use ensemble methods for combining predictions
```
