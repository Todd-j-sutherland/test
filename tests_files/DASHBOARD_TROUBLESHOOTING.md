# Dashboard Troubleshooting Guide

## âœ… Working Launch Command

The following command is confirmed to work:

```bash
cd /Users/toddsutherland/Repos/trading_analysis && source .venv/bin/activate && python launch_dashboard_auto.py
```

## ðŸ”§ Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Streamlit Email Prompt
**Problem**: Streamlit shows email prompt and dashboard won't start
**Solution**: Use the `launch_dashboard_auto.py` script which bypasses this automatically

### 2. "Site Cannot Be Reached"
**Problem**: Browser shows "site cannot be reached" at localhost:8501
**Solution**: This happens when Streamlit is stuck at the email prompt. Use the automated launcher.

### 3. Dashboard Not Loading
**Problem**: Dashboard starts but doesn't load properly
**Solution**: Check that all dependencies are installed:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Technical Analysis Errors
**Problem**: Technical analysis fails to load data
**Solution**: Ensure yfinance is installed:
```bash
pip install yfinance
```

### 5. Virtual Environment Issues
**Problem**: Commands don't work or packages missing
**Solution**: Always activate the virtual environment first:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
